<h2 class="super">LUDWIG THE SECOND<br>
KING OF BAVARIA</h2>
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">Descent and Education</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the birth of Ludwig II., enigmatic as he was
unfortunate, of whom I propose to give a sketch, his grandfather, the
eccentric Ludwig I., was still King of Bavaria. His father, Maximilian
Joseph, was the Crown Prince. The latter had wedded, in 1842, the
beautiful Princess Marie of Prussia, who was only sixteen years of age
at the time of her marriage, her husband being twenty years her
senior.</p>
<p class="par">To all appearance the marriage was a very happy one.
Maximilian was an intelligent and right-thinking man, devoted to public
duty, but he had indifferent health, and, like the greater number of
his race, was the possessor of a sensitive nervous system. For some
years it appeared as if the marriage would be childless. At the
beginning of the year 1845, however, the people of Bavaria were
informed that the Crown Princess was <i>enceinte</i>, and on the 25th
of August, on the birthday of the reigning King, a hundred <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>and one guns
proclaimed the birth of a prince at the ch&acirc;teau of
Nymphenburg.</p>
<p class="par">As a matter of fact, the princely infant had seen the
light two days earlier, but the event had been kept a secret in order
to give Ludwig I. a pleasant surprise, the King having expressed a wish
that a possible hereditary prince might come into the world on that
day. The child was named after him, and he held it himself at the
font.</p>
<p class="par">The old King at that time was at the height of his
popularity. Soon, however, a turning-point set in: the dancer Lola
Montez invaded the lovesick Monarch&rsquo;s life, causing a violent
insurrection in the Bavarian capital. Then came the democratic rising
of 1848, general all over Europe, which threw fuel on the fire. Ludwig
was compelled to abdicate, and was succeeded by his son, Maximilian
Joseph, who ascended the throne under the title of Maximilian II.</p>
<p class="par">Shortly after these political disturbances took place
the young Queen was brought to bed of another son, who was named
Otto.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e604src" href="#xd21e604" name=
"xd21e604src">1</a> The effect on her of the alarm and excitement
caused by the aforesaid events, was such that he came into the world
three months too early. The physicians declared that it was impossible
for the child to live, but they proved to be mistaken in their opinion.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Both the Crown Prince and his brother were unusually
good-looking, and it was a brilliant sight when the popular and
beautiful Queen walked about the streets of Munich, with her handsome
boys beside her. Maternal joy and pride shone from her eyes, and the
glance of the people was directed with genuine admiration on her and
her children. Otto was the one who most resembled his mother. Being,
moreover, lighthearted and accessible, he was also the one to whom the
prize of beauty was awarded by popular opinion. Ludwig&rsquo;s beauty
was of a more uncommon and intellectual type, a noteworthy feature of
his face being the large, brilliant, and dark-blue eye. The boys were
always dressed each in his particular colour, which the Queen herself
had chosen. Otto in red, and Ludwig in blue&mdash;the national colours
of Bavaria. Not only were Ludwig&rsquo;s clothes blue in tint, but
also, as far as was possible, his various other small possessions and
necessities; such, for instance, as the binding of his books, his
drawing portfolios, and his volumes of music. This hue always continued
to be his favourite colour.</p>
<p class="par">Possessed of good sense in many ways, Ludwig&rsquo;s
parents seem to have been deficient in their insight into the difficult
matter of bringing up their eldest son. The father was too strict, and
made demands on the Crown Prince with which his abilities and strength
did not allow of his complying. In season and out of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>season he
reminded him that some time or other he would be a king. He was
thoughtlessly punished whether he deserved it or whether his
delinquencies were of so insignificant a nature as to demand a certain
indulgence. Ludwig was not allowed to be a child. All his toys were
early taken from him. He had, for instance, a tortoise of which he was
particularly fond, but it was not long before this too was removed by
the King&rsquo;s especial order. The Queen made no attempt
independently to combat this unnatural bringing up; nor does she or the
King seem to have been alive to the fact that the peculiarities of the
Crown Prince&rsquo;s character required handling with caution.</p>
<p class="par">He was simultaneously the object in other quarters of a
directly opposite and still more pernicious treatment. His nurse
&ldquo;Liesi&rdquo; adored and spoiled him. When he became a little
older he was given a French governess, who seems to have had a
positively unfortunate influence upon him. Her great admiration was the
French <i lang="fr">Roi Soleil</i>, Louis XIV., and she made no secret
of forming her pupil upon this model. Well-known utterances of the
<i lang="fr">Grand Monarque</i>, such as &ldquo;<i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;&eacute;tat c&rsquo;est moi!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang=
"fr">Tel est notre bon plaisir</i>,&rdquo; and the like, were held up
to the royal pupil as models of parlance which ought to be copied;
while at the same time the governess gave expression in her looks and
words to the subservience which she considered becoming for a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>subject to show to a future monarch. She never asked
if he had been diligent and good. &ldquo;The Crown Prince is always the
first,&rdquo; she repeated invariably. A teacher of the French
language, who succeeded this lady, acted and comported himself in a
similar spirit, and contributed further to pervert the childish mind.
As an example of his method of education may be mentioned the fact that
<i lang="fr">le tr&egrave;s gracieux prince royal</i>, among other
things, was allowed to roll his teacher on the floor like a barrel.</p>
<p class="par">In such circumstances Ludwig&rsquo;s egotism could not
but be developed. Episodes from his childhood bear witness that a
decided vein of caprice and sense of his own importance were early to
be noticed in him. The following is a trait from the time when he was
twelve years of age, during a sojourn at Berchtesgaden. He was at play
in the park, with his brother. Without the slightest provocation he
suddenly threw Otto, three years younger than himself, on to the grass,
planted his knee firmly on the latter&rsquo;s chest, stuffed his
handkerchief into his mouth, and shouted commandingly: &ldquo;You are
my subject; you must obey me! Some time I shall be your king!&rdquo;
Happily a courtier was witness of this scene, and running forward, he
dragged Otto, who was almost suffocated, from his brother&rsquo;s
violent grasp. The incident came to the ears of the King. He gave his
first-born a sound thrashing in true burgher fashion. This corporal
punishment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>had not, however, the desired effect on the
exceedingly sensitive boy; and its result seems solely to have been
embitterment against his father. So much, indeed, did he take the
mortification of it to heart, that later he literally shunned
Berchtesgaden.</p>
<p class="par">One winter day in 1859 the two princes were together in
the so-called &ldquo;English Garden,&rdquo; in Munich. Otto was rolling
a large snowball, and called out to his brother, in glee: &ldquo;See,
Ludwig, I have a snowball that is bigger than your head!&rdquo; Ludwig
took it from him. Otto began to cry. Their tutor came up and asked what
was the matter. &ldquo;Ludwig has taken my snowball,&rdquo; sobbed
Otto. &ldquo;Your Royal Highness,&rdquo; said the tutor, &ldquo;if
Prince Otto has made a snowball it belongs to him, and you have no
right to take it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have I no right to take the snowball?
What am I Crown Prince for, then?&rdquo; asked Ludwig in dudgeon.</p>
<p class="par">A gentleman well known to Maximilian, and who was
frequently invited to his shooting parties, informs me that he very
seldom saw the little princes when he visited the King. Once when he
was walking in the gardens of the castle of Hohenschwangau, however, he
came upon an open space where the King&rsquo;s sons happened to be
playing. Ludwig had swung himself up on to a paling, and was running
backwards and forwards on it. The visitor reminded him that he might
fall and hurt himself. The boy, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>took no notice of the
well-meant warning, and its only result was that he increased his
antics. The gentleman, who was really afraid that an accident might
happen, now took him by force in his arms and lifted him down. The
Crown Prince glanced proudly at him; then began to play with his
brother, as if no third person was present. Many years afterwards, long
after Ludwig had become King, the same gentleman reminded him of this
occurrence. &ldquo;I remember very well,&rdquo; answered his Majesty
coldly, &ldquo;that you touched me at that time,&rdquo; and then turned
the subject of conversation.</p>
<p class="par">A strict system of economy formed a part of
Maximilian&rsquo;s curriculum. The royal princes were only allowed the
plainest food. Sweetmeats the Crown Prince tasted only through the
generosity of his nurse Liesi, who was in the habit of buying sweets
for her favourite out of her own pocket&mdash;a kindness which Ludwig
always remembered, and which he rewarded as soon as he became King.
When the princes grew bigger they were allowed pocket-money, to the
amount of about a shilling a week&mdash;hardly a princely appanage.
Otto one day hit upon a means, as he hoped, of improving his financial
position. Having heard that sound teeth fetched as much as ten guldens
apiece, he betook himself to one of the Munich dentists, and offered
him one of his best molars at that price. The dentist knowing who he
was, did not, of course, accept the offer. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>When the
occurrence became known to the King, the prince was severely punished.
The episode, however, seems to have brought the Queen to reflection,
and she caused the princes&rsquo; pocket-money to be augmented from
that day.</p>
<p class="par">On his eighteenth birthday Ludwig for the first time
received a sum of any consideration, his father presenting him with a
purse containing a specimen of every coin at that time current in
Bavaria. The youth, who had never before had anything in his pocket but
a few coppers, imagined that he had suddenly become a wealthy man, and
hastened off to buy and present to his mother a locket, which she had
admired in a jeweller&rsquo;s shop. He made no inquiries as to the
price, but when the jeweller observed that he would send the ornament
and the bill to the Palace, said with importance, handing him his
purse: &ldquo;No, I have money of my own now. Here, pay yourself for
the ornament!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Between the Crown Prince and his father there was never
any great feeling of tenderness, but he was without doubt very much
attached to his mother. The circumstances attending the birth of Prince
Otto had, however, given her a preference for her younger son; and when
Ludwig in his childish years endeavoured to talk to her of his ideas
and impressions, the very prosaic Queen showed a remarkable want of
comprehension of his poet&rsquo;s nature. Apart from occasional
friction, the relations between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9"
href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>the brothers were peaceful and
good. The younger one always took the second place, and the modesty
with which he did this was no doubt the chief reason why the two were
good friends. The entire character and turn of mind of the Crown
Prince, his ideas, pleasures, and sympathies, were absolutely different
from those of Otto, and of any real confidence on his side there could
consequently be no possibility. Ludwig preferred solitude. Otto was gay
and sociable. Ludwig was interested in art, and occupied himself with
flowers; his brother loved military matters, and was a keen sportsman.
Two interests, however, they had in common: both were from childhood
first-rate, almost foolhardy, riders, and both loved music and
singing.</p>
<p class="par">They had only two playmates, namely Prince Ludwig of
Hesse, who spent part of his childhood at the court of his aunt Queen
Marie, and Count Holstein, who now and then was allowed to visit them.
The Crown Prince was considered to be highly gifted. From his earliest
youth his memory was unusually good, and he often reduced his teachers
to despair by the puzzling questions he would put to them. Meanwhile he
was only diligent in the subjects which interested him, and lazy and
indifferent concerning those which did not please him. His teachers
were able and upright men, but towards the greater number of them he
was very reserved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>With a few exceptions they were powerless and
at their wit&rsquo;s end before this peculiar character, which
perplexed them by its contradictions and alarmed them by its outbursts
of violence.</p>
<p class="par">Thus grew up the Bavarian Crown Prince; in surroundings
which left him partly neglected and misunderstood and partly perverted
his understanding, and in circumstances which were fitted to develop
his already naturally marked egotism and feeling of self-esteem.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">Fundamental Traits of Ludwig&rsquo;s Character</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ludwig&rsquo;s tutor, the Count de Laros&eacute;e,
has expressed his conception of his pupil&rsquo;s character in the
following words: &ldquo;The Crown Prince is intelligent and highly
gifted. He is already possessed of abilities which far exceed the
ordinary. His imagination is so vivid, that I have seldom seen its
equal in so young a man; but he is hasty and exceedingly
quick-tempered. A more than strongly developed wilfulness points to a
stubbornness of character which is perhaps inherited from his
grandfather, and which it will be difficult for him to control.&rdquo;
This &ldquo;character&rdquo; was written out by the Count on the day
upon which Ludwig filled his eighteenth year, and on the tutor&rsquo;s
retirement from his responsible position.</p>
<p class="par">The Crown Prince had not merely inherited his
grandfather&rsquo;s obstinacy, but resembled in other ways his
father&rsquo;s father and his own namesake. Like him he was an idealist
and <i>Schw&auml;rmer</i>, with distinct leanings towards
&aelig;stheticism.</p>
<p class="par">Henrik Ibsen, in his play of <i>Ghosts</i>, allows
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>the characteristics of the progenitor to show
themselves already in the first generation. This is not commonly the
case. Far more frequently do the good and the bad &ldquo;family
ghosts&rdquo; come out in the second generation; and it may almost be
said that there are daily proofs that the son has more often the faults
and good qualities of his grandsire than of his sire. Such was the case
with Crown Prince Ludwig. To his careful, intelligent, and
conscientious father he had indeed little resemblance; but his
grandfather, the eccentric, stubborn, enthusiastic Ludwig I.,
&ldquo;walked&rdquo; in the grandson&mdash;not indeed &ldquo;over
again,&rdquo; as the saying is, but in a new edition, changed in
various ways though in other points easily recognisable. On his
mother&rsquo;s side there was also an enthusiast in the family.
Friedrich Wilhelm IV. of Prussia was Queen Marie of Bavaria&rsquo;s
first cousin, the son of her sister. There was in Ludwig&rsquo;s tastes
and turn of mind much that resembled this Prussian King, who in
contrast to the greater number of the Hohenzollerns took a greater
interest in science and art than in the profession of arms. But,
nevertheless, Ludwig II. was unique in his way. He was a peculiar,
strange figure in the midst of his immediate surroundings&mdash;an
enigma to his own race, as he was to his own people! He seems rather to
have belonged to another race than to the Teutonic one, and another age
than the nineteenth century. There are traits in his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>character which lead our thoughts back to the
times of Greek and Roman antiquity. In his instincts and his passions
he was closely allied to the Roman Emperor Hadrian. In one respect,
however, he was very modern, namely in his love of a mountain life. He
loved the alps; and it is characteristic of this shy King, who would
hardly undertake a journey that was not to his pleasure palaces, that
he repeatedly visited the alpine country <i>par excellence</i>, namely,
Switzerland.</p>
<p class="par">He inherited from both his parents his delight in the
mountains. The royal family were in the habit of spending the summers
at Schloss Hohenschwangau, in the Bavarian highlands, not far from
Munich. This was in reality an old castle, built a thousand years back
in time, but entirely reconstructed by Maximilian when he was Crown
Prince.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e688src" href="#xd21e688" name=
"xd21e688src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Many historical reminiscences and legends are connected
with the castle, whose halls are filled with memorials of days gone by,
and whose walls are decorated with pictures of Lohengrin and the swan
in every conceivable aspect. It is said that Hohenschwangau provided
Tannh&auml;user with a night&rsquo;s shelter when he was returning from
his pilgrimage to Rome. Martin Luther, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>too, during the time of
the Reformation, when he was in need and danger, is supposed to have
sought refuge in this castle, which is also known by the name of the
Wartburg of Bavaria.</p>
<p class="par">King Maximilian felt himself in better health after he
had spent the summer there, and with his wife, who was a bold climber,
was in the habit of going walking tours in the neighbouring country.
Hohenschwangau was the Queen&rsquo;s favourite place of residence. She
was unassuming, and exceedingly simple in her tastes, the charming
Marie finding her greatest pleasure in housewifely occupations. On
tablecloths which she had woven herself, she served fish caught by her
own hands. When in the country she was in the habit of going about in a
large kitchen apron, she dusted her own china and ornaments, and took
an innocent pleasure in washing up the used coffee-cups. Moreover, she
caused to be fitted up at Hohenschwangau, a spinning-room in which she
diligently turned her wheel for the benefit of the poor of the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="par">To their son Ludwig these visits were also a source of
pleasure, albeit in a manner differing from that of the other members
of the family. The great solitude had the effect on the boy&rsquo;s
impressionable mind of a release from oppressive chains. Here, with his
romantic disposition, the child found food for his vivid imagination;
here he could dream himself into the legendary lore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>of olden
days, and give free rein to his longing for the marvellous. On the
quiet paths he could immerse himself in the German classics, chiefly in
the works of Schiller, which spoke in living words to his heart and
mind, and he would at times spend half a day in declaiming the
resounding verses of his favourite poet.</p>
<p class="par">Strictly as he was brought up by his parents, he was at
times left too much to himself. He would withdraw in his free hours to
solitude and give himself up to day-dreams. &ldquo;How dull your Royal
Highness must find the want of occupation,&rdquo; said his tutor, Dean
von D&ouml;llinger, to him one day when he found him sitting alone in a
dark room on account of a slight eye affection. &ldquo;Why do you not
let some one read aloud to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not dull,&rdquo;
answered the Prince, &ldquo;I am thinking out different things, and I
amuse myself very well in this manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There are strange contrasts in Ludwig&rsquo;s character;
on the one side a yearning to escape from humanity, with its unnatural
and stilted aspects, to unalloyed nature, to the stillness, the
prayerful solemnity of solitude; on the other, even in his early years,
an enthusiastic love of plastic art, combined with a delight in
effective representations, for artificial brilliancy and pomp. So much,
indeed, was this the case, that the thought cannot but arise in the
mind that he was intended rather for the stage than for a throne. The
life of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>human community seemed to have no particular
interest, and still less attraction, for him. He stood uncomprehending,
and in a measure uncomprehended, before even the circle in which he
lived.</p>
<p class="par">But the serious moment was approaching. He had filled
his eighteenth year; duties and responsibilities awaited him. He was
now about to step out into public life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A feeling of gloom and sadness rested over Munich;
Maximilian II. was dying.</p>
<p class="par">On the 9th of March, 1864, he signed in his bed the last
documents of his reign. The same evening the doctors relinquished all
hope of being able to save his life. It had long been known that he was
a sick man, but no one had had any idea that his last hour was
approaching. The news, which was quickly spread, filled the capital
with dismay and lamentations. Immense crowds of people penetrated into
the courtyard of the Palace, and gazed up at their ruler&rsquo;s
windows.</p>
<p class="par">Snow and rain fell heavily. The wind howled, but no one
seemed to notice it. No longer was it possible to expect news which
might bring consolation. All were thinking the same thought: &ldquo;Our
good King is dying!&rdquo; The sorrow over the whole country was
indescribable. At four in the morning on the 10th of March the
physician-in-ordinary informed the sick man that he must prepare
himself for death, telling him at the same time that his confessor was
in the Palace. &ldquo;Has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>it come to this?&rdquo; asked
Maximilian, who felt exceedingly weak but suffered little pain.
&ldquo;Well, well&mdash;God will do the best for me! I have always
wished what was right.&rdquo; A believer, he made his confession and
received extreme unction.</p>
<p class="par">His despairing wife had spent the night in the
sick-room. The eighteen-year-old Crown Prince was now with his father.
The King had a prolonged private conversation with him, warning him,
counselling him, and endeavouring at the eleventh hour to gain the
confidence of his son, who had always withdrawn shyly into himself and
whose character was to him a riddle.</p>
<p class="par">He took an affecting and affectionate farewell of the
Queen and both his children, blessing them, and expressing a hope of
reunion. &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said to his successor, &ldquo;I hope
for you a death as quiet as your father&rsquo;s!&rdquo; These were his
last words. It would almost seem as if the veil over the events of the
future was lifted at this time to the view of the dying king, and that
he saw things which made him suspect or fear his son&rsquo;s tragic
ending. The Archbishop spoke words of consolation to the dying man as
he at midday, without a struggle, was called to the eternal rest.
Ludwig swooned with the strength of his emotions. Later in life he was
heard to say how painfully it had impressed him that he had been
greeted as the Sovereign as he left his father&rsquo;s deathbed.
&ldquo;The Lord has taken a good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>king away from us! Let us pray
that He will give us as good a king again!&rdquo; said the Archbishop
to the assembled courtiers, who were waiting outside. All fell on their
knees; tears and sobs filled the room. The capital and the kingdom were
weighed down by the pain of their loss.</p>
<p class="par">The sorrow at the demise of a highly venerated prince
was mingled with sympathy for his successor, who had been brought up so
strictly and in such loneliness. A heavy burden had with the mantle of
kingship been laid on his shoulders; the father&rsquo;s early death was
no doubt a misfortune to the son. The seeds of mental morbidness which
were slumbering within him would hardly have shot so soon into growth,
nor perhaps would Maximilian&rsquo;s principles of education have
brought about such distressing consequences, had not Ludwig become King
when he was in the midst of his development. He was too young and
unformed to be able to support without injury this forcible and sudden
transition. All the doors which previously had been shut to him were
now opened wide. All sought his favour. He was worshipped and
applauded, while his most commonplace utterances were given the
character of winged words.</p>
<p class="par">On the 12th of March he took the oath to the
Constitution, in the presence of the royal princes and the members of
the Council of State. The Minister of Foreign Affairs made a speech,
which the new King answered in the following words: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Almighty God has called my dear, greatly-beloved
father away from this world. I cannot give utterance to the feelings
with which my heart is filled. The task awaiting me is great and
arduous. I trust in God, Who will send me light and strength to fill
it. I will govern faithfully, in conformity with the oath which I have
just taken, and in conformity with the Constitution which has now
existed for nearly half-a-century. The welfare of my beloved Bavarians,
and the greatness of Germany, will be the object of my efforts. I ask
of all your assistance in the <span class="corr" id="xd21e737" title=
"Source: fulment">fulfilment</span> of my arduous duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig became popular without any effort whatever on his
side; the Bavarians are a loyal race, and strong ties knit the people
and the royal house together. Nor was the Monarch&rsquo;s sympathetic
appearance without its effect. All were struck by his beauty and
attractive personality.</p>
<p class="par">An Austrian writer who saw and talked with him soon
after his accession, several years afterwards expressed himself in the
following terms:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He was the handsomest youth I ever saw. His tall,
slim figure was perfectly symmetrical. His abundant, lightly curling
hair, and the slight indication of a beard lent to his head a likeness
to those great antique works of art, through which we have found the
representation of the Hellenic conception of manly strength. Even had
he been a beggar he must have attracted my attention. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>No
person, whether old or young, rich or poor, could remain unaffected by
the charm of his whole person. His voice was agreeable. The questions
he asked were concise and decided, his subjects were well-chosen and
intellectual, and he expressed himself easily and naturally. The
admiration he aroused in me has never diminished, but on the contrary
has increased with years. The picture of the young Monarch is still
imprinted in unfading colours on my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Another German writer, Paul Heyse, met the young King
about the same time, and has likewise published his impressions of him.
He is not quite so enthusiastic in his admiration, but seems also to
have been impressed. &ldquo;The large eyes,&rdquo; says Heyse,
&ldquo;were dreamy, the glance winning. What he said was entirely
without any trace of embarrassment. His judgment of those in his
proximity was unusually certain, and his knowledge of human nature
wonderful, in view of his lonely education, so far away from the
world.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">A Plan of Marriage</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Shortly after his ascent of the throne Ludwig was
visited by the Emperor and Empress of Austria. Elizabeth was his
cousin. At the time that she went to Vienna as Empress he was only nine
years old. She had, later, often visited her parental home and the
Bavarian royal family; but on these occasions the shy and retiring
Crown Prince had hardly been allowed to see and talk to the beautiful
sovereign of the great neighbouring state. Matters were now changed.
Now he was King, and there was soon knitted between these two a bond of
friendship which lasted until Ludwig&rsquo;s death. He received the
Emperor and Empress with every mark of attention, endeavouring to make
their sojourn in his capital as pleasant and gay as possible. From
Munich, Franz Josef and his consort went on to Kissingen, where Ludwig
paid them a return visit. At this noted resort the young King of
Bavaria was received with enthusiasm. Here also he met the Russian
royal family. The Empress Maria Alexandrowna met him with motherly
kindness, and seems at once to have formed the plan of making him her
son-in-law. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>Bavaria was not, indeed, a great power, but it was
a respected kingdom of the second class. The Bavarian dynasty was old
and esteemed; and its present head was a brilliant personality, and, as
it appeared, noble and amiable in character. To Ludwig also, and the
country he represented, a connection of the kind must have presented
itself as suitable and desirable; albeit, the Grand Duchess
Maria&mdash;the only daughter of the Emperor and Empress&mdash;was at
that time a mere child.</p>
<p class="par">From Kissingen the Russian royal family went on to
Schwalbach. After a short stay in Munich the King of Bavaria sought
them there, accompanying&mdash;their untiring knight&mdash;the mother
and daughter in their excursions.</p>
<p class="par">This scheme of marriage, entertained by the Russian and
the Bavarian courts, extended over several years. It seems to be proved
beyond all doubt that Ludwig for a time thought of asking the Grand
Duchess&rsquo;s hand. He even had the plans drawn of a
Gr&aelig;co-Muscovite palace, which he intended should be his wedding
gift to the bride, and where, as a newly-married couple, they should
spend their honeymoon.</p>
<p class="par">The following summer the Tsarina and her daughter came
again to Kissingen; there again the King met them. The mutual
amiabilities and civilities recommenced, and the Empress and the
Bavarian Ministers still seemed eager to have the connection brought
about. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>announcement of the engagement was expected every
day. But it was expected in vain. The King hesitated to say the
decisive word; as a matter of fact, he never said it. People tried to
guess the reason. Some thought that the Tsarina&rsquo;s too great
eagerness for the match had cooled his own ardour for it. Others
thought that the beauty-loving youth had hesitated because he had
discovered that the little Russian Princess had a higher heel on one
foot than on the other. Hardly any one suspected the real reason. It
must be sought in Ludwig&rsquo;s restless, undecided temperament, and
in his inborn aversion to entering the married state.<a class="noteref"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2 class="main">King Ludwig and Richard Wagner</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Richard Wagner, in the preface to his <i lang=
"de">Niebelungenlied</i>, asks the following question:&mdash;&ldquo;Is
the prince to be found who will make possible the representation of my
work?&rdquo; Ludwig of Bavaria read these lines as Crown Prince, and
exclaimed, with enthusiasm: &ldquo;When <i>I</i> am a King I will show
the world how highly I prize his genius!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Hardly a month after his accession Ludwig sent his
private secretary, Herr von Pfistermeister, to invite Wagner to Munich.
The secretary sought Wagner first in Vienna; but the poet-musician had
been obliged to flee the Austrian capital for some place where his
pursuers could not reach him, having been threatened with arrest for
debt. He was traced to some friends in Stuttgart. There the
King&rsquo;s emissary delivered to him a photograph of Ludwig and a
ring, set with a ruby, and informed him that, as the stone in the ring
glowed, so his ruler burned with longing to behold him.</p>
<p class="par">On his sixteenth birthday the Crown Prince of Bavaria
had been present at a representation of <i>Lohengrin</i>. This opera
had made the deeper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26"
name="pb26">26</a>]</span>impression on him from the fact that the
legend of the swan knights was connected with Hohenschwangau, which, as
we know, had been from his childhood his favourite place of residence.
During the years preceding his ascent of the throne his interest in the
&ldquo;musician of the future&rdquo; increased. When visiting his aunt,
the Duchess Ludovica, at Possenhofen, he had found Wagner&rsquo;s
compositions on her pianoforte, and from this time forth he studied his
works with zeal. Ludwig was not the possessor of any distinctly musical
gifts. A musician who gave him lessons on the piano was even of opinion
that he was wanting in ear; and Wagner&rsquo;s works probably attracted
him more from their fantastic poetry than on account of their musical
qualities.</p>
<p class="par">It was with feelings of joyful expectation that the
master accepted the young King&rsquo;s invitation. He arrived at Munich
at the beginning of May (1864), and was received with consideration.
His personality made a strong impression on Ludwig, who assured him of
his favour and warm interest. &ldquo;The unthinkable, and the only
thing that I required, has become a reality. Heaven has sent me a
patron. Through him I live and understand myself!&rdquo; exclaimed the
poet-musician to friends who were awaiting him on his return from the
Palace. After staying a few days in the Bavarian capital he continued
his journey to Vienna, being now able, thanks to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>Ludwig&rsquo;s generosity, to discharge his debts.
He soon, however, returned to Munich, and Pfistermeister, in the name
of his master, bade him welcome to a beautifully situated villa on the
lake of Starnberg, where he might live undisturbed for his art.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig was in residence at this time at the adjacent
Schloss Berg, where Wagner frequently visited him, and performed his
works before him. The master&rsquo;s imagination, poetry, his
attractive manner, all transformed the royal enthusiast&rsquo;s
admiration into blind admiration. The elder man exerted a superhuman
power over the youth, and his proximity had a positively electrifying
effect on the King. Their life together became a decisive event in the
lives of both. Full of pity for him, and happy in the consciousness of
being able to assist him, Ludwig wrote on the day following their first
meeting: &ldquo;Feel assured that I will do all that lies in my power
to make reparation to you for your earlier sufferings. I will for ever
chase away the trifling sorrows of everyday life from your head. I will
give you the repose you require, so that undisturbed in the pure sphere
of your art you can unfold your genius in its entirety.... Unknowingly
you were the only source of my joys. From my earliest years you were to
me a friend who as no other spoke to my heart, my best teacher and
upbringer.&rdquo; In spite of their difference in age it is placed
beyond a doubt, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>that Wagner from the first moment warmly
reciprocated the feelings of his protector. He thus writes to his
friend Frau von Wille (May 1864): &ldquo;He (the King) is unhappily so
handsome and so intellectual, so full of soul and so glorious, that I
fear his life must disappear like a fleeting dream of gods in this
commonplace world. He loves me with the tenderness and warmth of first
love. He knows me and all about me, and understands me as he does his
own soul. He wishes me to live with him altogether, to work, rest, and
have my works performed. He will give me everything I may require for
this purpose. I am to complete the &ldquo;Ring&rdquo;; and he will have
them put on the stage in the manner I desire. I am to be my own master,
not <i>Kapelmeister</i>, nothing except myself and his friend!... All
need is to be taken away from me, I am to have all that I require, only
I am to remain with him!... You cannot imagine the charm of his glance.
I only hope he may live; it is a real marvel!&rdquo; Of their personal
intercourse he writes, on another occasion: &ldquo;I always hasten to
him as to a loved one. It is a glorious intercourse ... and, in
addition, this kind care of me, this charming modesty of the heart when
he assures me of his happiness in possessing me. We often sit for hours
lost in the contemplation of one another.&rdquo; The same feeling of
exuberant joy is apparent in a letter written on the 20th of May to his
friend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>Weissheimer: &ldquo;Only two words to assure you
of the indescribable happiness which has become my lot. Everything has
happened in such a manner that it is impossible to imagine it more
beautiful. Thanks to the affection of the young King, I am for all time
insured against every pecuniary care. I can work, I need not trouble
myself about anything. No title, no functions, no duties! As soon as I
wish anything staged the King places everything I require at my
disposal.... My young King is a wonderful dispensation of fate to me.
We love one another as only master and pupil can love one another. He
is happy in having me and I am happy on account of him.... And then he
is so beautiful, so profound, that daily intercourse with him carries
me away, and gives me an entirely new life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Already at this time, however, he adds: &ldquo;You can
imagine what a vast amount of envy I meet with!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The same year he addresses Ludwig:<a class="noteref" id=

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=

<p class="par">At the beginning of October, Wagner moved from the lake
of Starnberg to Munich, Ludwig having given him a furnished villa in
Brienner Strasse. The royal gardeners transformed an adjoining garden
into a pretty park, and he was granted a considerable monthly pension.
The intercourse between the friends continued apparently undisturbed;
they spent their days in each other&rsquo;s society, and often remained
together half the night. The Monarch showered gifts on the
poet-musician, and fulfilled all his wishes.</p>
<p class="par">On the 25th of November the newspapers of the capital
published an official announcement, which ran as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;His Majesty has decided that a school of operatic
music shall be founded, under the direction of Wagner, in which male
and female singers who wish to prepare themselves for the stage may
receive the necessary practical instruction. The royal Residenz Theater
will be placed at the disposal of the pupils for purposes of
rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i lang="de">Der Fliegende Holl&auml;nder</i> was given
at the Hof Theater on the 4th of December. The house was filled to
overflowing, and the audience followed the opera with interest. Wagner,
who made his first public appearance that evening as conductor in
Munich, was recalled after the second act and the conclusion of the
performance. In order further to seal the position he had won, it was
decided that he should give a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>concert the following Sunday in the
Hof Theater, where several of his compositions would be performed. It
was, however, badly attended; and the critics deemed Wagner more a poet
than a musician.</p>
<p class="par">A few weeks afterwards the King received in special
audience the architect Semper, who had come to Munich at the suggestion
of Wagner, it being the latter&rsquo;s wish that a large new theatre
after his own notions should be built in the Bavarian capital. It was
intended that this edifice should be situated on the highest part of
the Maximilian Anlage, a bridge in Renaissance style being thrown
across the river. The cost of the theatre was estimated at a million
guldens, and including the projected bridge and laying out of the
adjacent ground, Semper further calculated the sum necessary at five
millions of guldens. His plans and drawings met with Ludwig&rsquo;s
fullest approval. The officials of the privy purse, however, used to
the economy of former reigns, strongly opposed the scheme. The King,
therefore, thought himself constrained to postpone indefinitely the
execution of his plans; and later on entirely abandoned them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e859src" href="#xd21e859" name="xd21e859src">2</a>
The capital of Bavaria was the loser by this, for the theatre would not
only have been an embellishment to the town, but would have attracted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>thither a countless number of visitors. The outlay
in course of time would have been covered many times over.</p>
<p class="par">The real opposition against Wagner began in Munich on
the day when his extensive theatre plans became known. The nobility saw
in him the bad genius of the young King, one who would prevent the
aristocracy and gentry from having access to the presence. The clergy
were incensed against him because he was a freethinker. Among musicians
there was a considerable number who admired the composer of <i lang=
"de">Der Fliegende Holl&auml;nder</i>, <i lang="de">Lohengrin</i>, and
<i lang="de">T&auml;nnhauser</i>, but who, nevertheless, frankly
opposed the &ldquo;music of the future&rdquo; as an aberration. Others
of his fellows looked upon him as the greatest musical genius of that
day; but they envied his ability to bask in the favour of royalty, and
dragged his personal weaknesses forth before the public.</p>
<p class="par">Wagner, on his side, was not without blame in these
enmities. The exaggerated luxury displayed by him incensed the thrifty
burghers. At every turn he boasted of the royal favour. It was
generally said that he misused his protector&rsquo;s open purse. He was
in the habit of buying articles on credit and referring the purveyors
for payment to his &ldquo;royal friend,&rdquo; and it was feared in
extended circles that he was leading Ludwig into profligacy. He,
moreover, caused a considerable amount of ill-feeling by his
irritability and impatience where the execution of his plans
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>was concerned. A large part of the press began to
show hostility towards him; the comic papers occupied themselves with
him; and he suffered much under the forging of these links: On the 7th
of March 1865 he wrote to August R&ouml;ckl: &ldquo;All I want is to
get away to a pretty corner of Italy ... so as to be able to nurse my
poor nerves. But how, on the other hand, can I leave this poor young
King, in his abominable surroundings, and with his heart so wonderfully
fastened on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At Wagner&rsquo;s suggestion the King summoned Hans von
B&uuml;low and several of the musician&rsquo;s other adherents to
Munich. B&uuml;low was appointed court choirmaster and
&ldquo;leader&rdquo; to his Majesty. He treated the artists of the
royal chapel like schoolboys. They were received in the best society of
the capital, and their displeasure was implanted further. On the 7th of
May 1865 the following announcement appeared in the <i lang=
"de">Neuesten Nachrichten</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Men whose veracity we have
no reason to doubt inform us that at a recent rehearsal of
Wagner&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Tristan und Isolde</i> Herr von B&uuml;low
demanded an extension of the orchestra. The stage manager, Herr
Penckmayer, answered that in such a case thirty stalls would have to be
done away with. B&uuml;low thereupon observed: &lsquo;What does it
matter if there are thirty rascals more or less in the
theatre!&rsquo;&rdquo; The overstrung musician frequently let his sharp
tongue run away with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"
name="pb34">34</a>]</span>him, and could not deny that he had made use
of this expression. He found himself obliged to declare publicly that
in saying so he had in his mind only that portion of the public who had
taken up a hostile attitude towards Wagner. The general dislike of Hans
von B&uuml;low, despite his admitted ability, was very detrimental to
the poet-composer; moreover, others of his friends who had come to
Munich at this time wounded the inhabitants of the city by their
frankly expressed contempt for its music, and by permitting themselves
criticisms at its expense. But more than anything else public opinion
was incensed against Wagner from the fact that Frau Cosima von
B&uuml;low, <i>n&eacute;e</i> <span class="corr" id="xd21e892" title=
"Source: Lisst">Liszt</span>, had attained the part of lady of the
house at the villa in Brienner Strasse.</p>
<p class="par">It became known that the mutual admiration between her
and Wagner had taken the form of a <i>liaison</i>, and the judges of
morality on this ground sided vehemently against him. Only at the court
did his position appear to be unshaken. Ludwig did not hear the reports
which were current with regard to B&uuml;low&rsquo;s wife and his
friend, nor had he more than a slight knowledge of the hostility of
which the latter was the object. Articles in the different newspapers
which had come to his knowledge had, however, greatly embittered the
sensitive youth. &ldquo;Forgive them, for they know not what they
do,&rdquo; he wrote, with reference to this, to Wagner. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>&ldquo;They do not know that you are everything to
me, and will continue to be so until death.&rdquo; In another letter he
exclaims: &ldquo;Ah, my friend, how difficult they make things for us!
But I will not complain. I have him, my friend, the only
one.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e902src" href="#xd21e902" name=
"xd21e902src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">At the Hof Theater in Munich the master&rsquo;s glorious
composition <i lang="de">Tristan und Isolde</i> was being studied, no
theatre up to this time having attempted to produce it. The well-known
singers Ludwig and Malwina Schnorr von Carolsfeld came from Dresden to
take the title parts. B&uuml;low, whom the composer called &ldquo;his
other self,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e916src" href="#xd21e916"
name="xd21e916src">4</a> was to conduct the opera. The rehearsals began
in Wagner&rsquo;s house, but were later transferred to the royal
Residenz Theater which was placed at his absolute disposal for this
purpose. The master instructed each one of the artists himself. The
little man with the great head was all fire, carrying everyone with
him. When a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>difficult passage had been performed with especial
success he would spring up and kiss and embrace the singer, male or
female; and at times even stand on his head on the sofa from sheer
delight.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e924src" href="#xd21e924" name=
"xd21e924src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">The performances of <i lang="de">Tristan und Isolde</i>
had been fixed for the 15th, the 18th, and the 22nd of May, the latter
day being Wagner&rsquo;s birthday. His followers, and representatives
of the press, had come from all parts of Germany and from abroad, to be
present at the representation, which was considered an event in the
musical world. But Frau Schnorr von Carolsfeld suddenly fell ill, and
the performance had to be postponed.</p>
<p class="par">It was not until the 10th of June that the first
performance could take place. Early in the forenoon all the seats in
the house were sold at considerably increased prices. The royal boxes,
flanking the stage, were filled with spectators: among those present
being Prince Luitpold with his elder sons, Prince Adalbert with his
wife, King Ludwig I., and Duke Max, who nearly all remained in the
theatre until the conclusion of the opera.</p>
<p class="par">At ten minutes past six the King appeared in the
so-called &ldquo;Imperial box.&rdquo; He was received with loud
acclamations, and the orchestra added its quota of fanfares. Ludwig was
evidently pleased, and thanked his people by bowing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>cordially to all sides. The next moment Hans von
B&uuml;low stepped into the conductor&rsquo;s place, and the
performance began.</p>
<p class="par">It was not at that time usual to applaud the actors and
actresses when the Sovereign was present, until the latter had given
the signal. After the first act, however, a great number of those
present were so delighted that they could not refrain from recalling
Herr and Frau Schnorr von Carolsfeld. No sooner had they done this than
hisses were to be heard, though deadened by applause. After the second
act the two chief singers were recalled, this time amid unanimous
recognition. At eleven o&rsquo;clock the performance concluded. Once
again there was a difference of opinion, and applause and hisses sought
for mastery. Herr and Frau Schnorr von Carolsfeld led Wagner on to the
stage. He was received with a storm of ovations, though here and there
hisses were audible. The King, who had followed the performance with
the most strained attention, and who in the third act had been affected
to tears, trembled with emotion. He stood up in his box, and clapped
enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="par">At last there was quiet; the curtain fell.
Wagner&rsquo;s genius had conquered.</p>
<p class="par">There was not in the whole of Europe a newspaper of any
consideration, still less one for the criticism of music, which did not
mention this evening. Opinions as to the work were divided, but there
was only one opinion as to the excellence <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>of the orchestra under
Hans von B&uuml;low&rsquo;s leadership and the singing of Ludwig and
Malwina Schnorr von Carolsfeld. A Frenchman who was present
wrote<a class="noteref" id="xd21e950src" href="#xd21e950" name=
"xd21e950src">6</a>: &ldquo;I doubt that Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Tristan</i>
will ever be popular, for it is not remarkable for clearness and
simplicity. On the other hand, musicians will find treasures in
it.&mdash;I have never been present at an opera which so quickly
wearies the attention and which demands such an immense amount of
mental strain. But neither do I know any with such lofty and enchanting
beauties.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We must do the young King the justice to allow
that without him the representation could never have been possible. He
has worked for it with all his might, and Wagner&rsquo;s triumph is in
truth his. Ludwig&rsquo;s behaviour during the five hours that the
opera lasted was likewise a feature in the play. Be sure that this
young man will cause the world to talk about him! A Monarch of twenty
years more open-minded than his Opposition, whom he drives
forward&mdash;a King who does not draw back before the highest problems
in art is a rare figure in history!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Wagner received from his royal protector a letter in
which was written:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first salute">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Uplifted, Divine

<p class="par">&ldquo;I can hardly wait for the morrow, I long so

I ask you never to lose heart. I ask it of you in the name of those
whom you fill with joy&mdash;a joy which otherwise only God grants!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You and God!</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">To Hans von B&uuml;low likewise he expressed his thanks
in a flattering letter, which was accompanied by a diamond ring; and he
also caused diamond rings to be conveyed to Herr and Frau Schnorr von
Carolsfeld, in which souvenirs of the festival were ingeniously set.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Ludwig&rsquo;s First Visit to
Switzerland&mdash;Richard Wagner leaves Munich</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We know that Schiller, from Ludwig&rsquo;s
childhood, had been his favourite poet. At Munich, as in all other
theatres, the master&rsquo;s works had hitherto only been given in an
abridged form. But the &ldquo;romanticist on the throne,&rdquo;
commanded that in his own theatre they should be played as the poet
himself had intended. On the 18th of October 1865 <i>Wilhelm Tell</i>
was performed for the first time in its original shape.</p>
<p class="par">After this representation the King was taken with the
desire to know the people and the country which Schiller had glorified
in his work. Accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Prince Paul of Thurn and
Taxis, he started on the 20th of October for Switzerland. In Lucerne,
which he made his headquarters, he went to the hotel Schweizer Hof. His
arrival being unannounced, and no one recognising him, he was given a
room on the third floor. The consternation among the <i>personnel</i>
of the establishment may be imagined when it became known the following
day that it was the King of Bavaria who had been lodged so high up. The
landlord, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>dismay, hastened upstairs to make his apologies,
and offered Ludwig the suite of rooms on the ground floor in which
royal personages were usually accommodated. Ludwig declined the offer
with his kindest smile, declaring that he was satisfied with his little
room on the third floor, with its pretty view over the lake and
mountains, and that he would not leave it.</p>
<p class="par">From Lucerne he made excursions to places in the
woodland cantons rich in legendary lore: to &ldquo;R&uuml;tli&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tells-Platte,&rdquo; &ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e1007"
title="Source: Staffachers">Stauffachers</span> Kapel,&rdquo; to the
K&uuml;snach gorge, and several other places.</p>
<p class="par">The hearts of the inhabitants went out to the handsome,
enthusiastic youth. The <i lang="de">Schwyzer Zeitung</i> published
after his departure some hearty words of appreciation and farewell.
This he answered in an autograph letter which ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first salute">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Herr
Redakteur!</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was with the greatest pleasure that I read
to-day the warm farewell from &ldquo;William Tell&rsquo;s&rdquo; land,
and I answer it from my heart.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I send my greeting likewise to my dear friends in
the forest cantons, for whom already as a child I had a particular
affection.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The recollection of my visit to the glorious
interior of Switzerland and of the honest, free <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>people,

<p class="par">&ldquo;With the kindest feelings, I am,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;Your gracious,<br>
&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ludwig</span>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hohenschwangau, November the second,
1865.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">On his return home Ludwig invited Richard Wagner to
visit him; and on the 10th of November the two friends were again
together in the &ldquo;Swan Castle.&rdquo; It was intended to open at
the beginning of the year 1866 the new school of music and dramatic
art, with Hans von <span class="corr" id="xd21e1043" title=
"Source: B&uuml;low&rsquo;s">B&uuml;low</span> as Principal. Wagner had
much upon his mind which he desired to ask of his royal friend, and was
so satisfied with his stay at Hohenschwangau that after his return home
he telegraphed to one of his adherents:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The year 1866 is ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile there were forces working from different
quarters to destroy the friendship between him and Ludwig. The
Secretary and the Keeper of the Privy Purse, who had enjoyed the late
King&rsquo;s confidence for years, considered it to be their duty to
counteract the tendency to extravagance which was showing itself in the
young Sovereign. They received support from the numerous opponents of
the poet-musician. The opposition grew into a perfect tumult; for the
people, who could neither understand his relations with Ludwig nor his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>artistic objects, believed in the alarming
pictures of him which his enemies sowed broadcast in words and
writings. &ldquo;Well-informed persons,&rdquo; wrote the
<i>Volksbote</i>, &ldquo;affirm that Wagner within less than a year has
cost the privy purse no less than a million and nine hundred thousand
guldens. We do not vouch for the accuracy of the amount stated; but we
may mention it as certain that Wagner some weeks ago once more demanded
forty thousand guldens in order to satisfy his expensive habits. Herr
von Pfistermeister has advised the Sovereign not to grant this new and
excessive demand. As a result of this Richard Wagner has written in his
anger a letter very far from polite to Herr von Pfistermeister; and
finally he has in spite of everything received the sum he
desired.&rdquo; Ministers, Councillors of State, burgher
representatives, all took part against him. Among the general public
opinions were, however, somewhat divided. The following episode
occurred in a railway train. A Catholic priest expressed disapproval of
his Majesty for making so much of &ldquo;Lutheran musicians.&rdquo; To
this a peasant who was sitting in the same carriage, replied: &ldquo;I
would rather see the King with musicians than with priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Secretary was looked upon by Wagner as the
instigator of all the opposition the latter met with, and on many
occasions he expressed himself in disparaging terms of this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>greatly respected man. In the other camp, on the
contrary, Pfistermeister was greatly admired on account of the bold
stand he was making against the inconsiderate demands of the master,
the Conservative papers siding strongly with him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 4th of December an address of confidence was laid
out in the business houses of Munich for signature, which it was
intended should be presented to Herr von Pfistermeister by a
deputation. It also contained a request that he would continue to stand
fast by the King&rsquo;s side. Ludwig received official information of
these facts, and at the same time it was made known to him how
unpopular Wagner had made himself. On the 5th of December he moved from
Hohenschwangau back to the Royal Palace at Munich. On the same day his
mother, his great-uncle Prince Karl, Archbishop Scherr, and the
Premier, Baron von der Pfordten, went to the Palace. In his capacity as
Minister of the Royal Household, the latter handed him a memorandum in
which he threatened to retire if Wagner did not leave Bavaria. Prince
Karl gave forcible expression to the belief of the court that this
friendship would have disastrous consequences. The police would no
longer answer for the poet-composer&rsquo;s safety. Lacqueys who were
questioned let fall hints that a revolution might break out under the
present condition of affairs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The King had weak nerves, and was not a man of
conspicuous bravery. Wagner&rsquo;s violence and exactions had many
times caused him difficulties. He felt himself, moreover, greatly hurt
by the manner in which his name had been mixed up in the matter. The
attacks of the press and the threats of his relations and councillors
would hardly, however, have been sufficient to separate him from his
friend, had not another reason been added to them: he had received
incontrovertible proof that the poet-composer had a <i>liaison</i> with
Frau Cosima von B&uuml;low. These proofs, for which he was quite
unprepared, made a far more painful impression on him than the meddling
of his friends and the malicious fulminations of the press.</p>
<p class="par"><i lang="de">Schw&auml;rmerei</i> was a prominent trait
in his character, and he had fixed all his affections on Richard
Wagner. The predominant feeling of the latter was primarily gratitude
to his royal patron; but there is no doubt, judging by the letters and
poems from his hand, that he also cherished very great sympathy for the
gifted youth. But Ludwig was of a jealous nature. He wished to be loved
for his own sake; and he wished to possess his friend alone. The
connection with Frau von B&uuml;low, therefore, became a source of
bitter and continual disappointment to him. The same day that he
ascertained the fact with certainty, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>he sent the Premier a
document in which he made known his desire that Wagner should at once
leave Munich. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said on this occasion,
&ldquo;show my dear people that their confidence in, and love for, me
stands higher than any other consideration.&rdquo; To von Lutz, later
his Minister, was allotted the task of verbally informing Wagner of the
decision which had been taken with regard to him. The same evening he
visited the Hof Theater with the Queen-mother. Instead of the warm
welcome he was in the habit of receiving when he had been absent for
some time, a murmur of displeasure was heard. He thought to see in this
a confirmation of the current of public feeling. The following morning
he sent Wagner an autograph letter, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first salute">&ldquo;<span class="sc">My dear
Friend</span>,</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Greatly as it pains me, I must ask you to comply
with the wish I expressed yesterday through my secretary. Believe me, I
was obliged to act thus! My affection for you will last for ever. I ask
you, also, always to keep your friendship for me. It is with a good
conscience that I dare say that I am worthy of it.... Who has the right
to part us?... I know that you feel as I do, that you can perfectly
measure my deep sorrow. I could not act otherwise, be convinced of
this! Never doubt the faithfulness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>of your greatest friend.... It
is not for ever.</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;To death,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;Your faithful,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ludwig</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Even before the official organ of the Government had
announced this sensational banishment, the news had been disseminated
with lightning rapidity. The 8th of December was a holiday.
Nevertheless, a meeting of magistrates was convened to discuss the
propriety of sending a deputation to the King, to express the
city&rsquo;s thanks. The debate was protracted and sharp; it was
finally agreed that the deputation should not be sent. Nor did a
torchlight procession which had been thought of, take place.</p>
<p class="par">While the Clerical and some of the Liberal papers were
overjoyed at Ludwig&rsquo;s action, the Progressive organ observed that
&ldquo;the august relatives, members of the nobility, and officials of
Church and State who had informed the King of the prevailing condition
of public feeling had been incorrect in their statements.
Wagner&rsquo;s presence had done nothing to alarm the people, and had
in no way diminished their love of the King. Wagner&rsquo;s person had
had nothing whatever to do with the internal affairs of the country,
and with the efforts of the Progressive party.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On the 10th of December the master left <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Munich.
Despite the cold of winter and the dark early morning hour, the railway
station was filled with people anxious to see him and bid him good-bye.
Ludwig had sent him a last farewell letter, brimming over with
sorrow:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">My precious
tenderly loved Friend</span>,</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Words cannot express the pain gnawing at my
heart. Whatever it is possible to do to refute the abominable newspaper
accounts shall be done. That it should have come to this! Our ideals
shall be faithfully cultivated&mdash;I need hardly tell you this. Let
us write often and much to one another. I ask it of you! We know each
other, and we will not give up the friendship which binds us. For the
sake of your peace I had to act as I have done.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do not misjudge me, not for a moment; it would be
the pangs of hell to me.... Success to my most beloved friend! May his
works flourish. A hearty greeting with my whole soul from</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;Your faithful,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ludwig</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Wagner went to Switzerland and took up his abode
there.</p>
<p class="par">Neither the King nor his advisers thought that the
banishment would be for ever. The poet-musician did, indeed, return to
Munich, on visits of short duration, but he never stayed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>there
again for any length of time. The good relations between him and Ludwig
were never broken, and the gallant Monarch continued to hold his
protecting hand over him. He worked zealously for the inauguration of
the Wagner Theatre at Bayreuth, and the royal pension was paid without
reduction out of the privy purse until the death of Wagner in 1883.
Frau Cosima, however, who had been one of the causes of the
friends&rsquo; separation, was unable to congratulate herself on any
favour whatsoever; she might not have existed as far as the ruler of
Bavaria was concerned. As a widow she sought an audience of him, to
thank him for the proofs of affection he had shown her husband. Ludwig
refused to receive her. &ldquo;I do not know any Frau Cosima
Wagner,&rdquo; he said coldly.</p>
<p class="par">Although he had voluntarily sent the master away, and
although, as we have seen, other reasons than the voice of opinion had
influenced his decision, Ludwig never forgave the citizens of Munich
for the part they had taken in disturbing a friendship which had been
the source to him of so much consolation and pleasure. The aversion
which he showed the capital on many later occasions was first awakened
by this circumstance. The severance not only left behind it a profound
feeling of loneliness, but also, in his sensitive heart, a bitterness
which boded ill for the future. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50"
href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His too great love for me,&rdquo; wrote Wagner,
on the 26th of December 1865, to Frau Wille, &ldquo;made him blind to
other connections, and therefore he was easily disappointed. He knows
nobody, and it is only now that he is learning to know people. Still I
hope for him. As I am sure of his enduring affection, so I believe in
the development of his splendid qualities. All he requires is to learn
to know a few more people. He will then rapidly learn to do the right
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of July 1867 he wrote in a letter to Malvida
von Meysenburg:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The only thing that kept me back in Munich was
affection for my friend, for whose sake I have suffered more than for
any other person.... I have saved him, and still hope that I have kept
in him one of my best works for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Among Wagner&rsquo;s contemporaries there were but few
who were disposed to share his belief that he had saved the young King.
On the contrary, public opinion affirmed that it was he who had given
Ludwig a taste for the nocturnal life which entirely undermined his
nervous system, and that by his exaggerated poems of homage he had laid
the foundation of the megalomania which later developed in him. At the
time of Ludwig&rsquo;s death it was even declared that this friend was
concerned in the tragedy of the Starnberger See. The latter is, of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>course, an unproved and improvable affirmation.
With quite as much reason might it be said that Ludwig II.&mdash;morbid
as he was&mdash;had need of some person who by the power of music could
soothe him in his suffering condition. Certain it is that from the day
when the separation from Richard Wagner took place the King&rsquo;s
spirit became less, and his life more joyless than it had been
before.</p>
<p class="par">It has also been thought that Wagner meddled in the
guidance of political affairs. This, however, is incorrect. There were,
indeed, many who credited him with an all-powerful influence over the
King, and he himself mentions this in a letter to a friend: &ldquo;I
pass for a favourite who can bring everything about. The other day even
a murderess&rsquo;s relations addressed themselves to me!&rdquo; It is
also said that, at the time when war seemed to be imminent between
Prussia and Austria, an endeavour was made through Wagner to induce
Ludwig to remain neutral. All, however, who are in a position to know,
are agreed that in the fulfilment of his duties as a ruler the young
Monarch never allowed himself to be influenced by him. Wagner has on
countless occasions declared that he never talked politics with the
King, because the latter had forbidden him to do so. When he touched
upon a topic which might in any way have led the conversation into this
channel, Ludwig would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52"
name="pb52">52</a>]</span>gaze up at the ceiling and whistle, as a sign
that he did not desire a continuation of the subject.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, in summing up the relations between the two
friends, it must not be forgotten that, after Wagner&rsquo;s genius, it
is to the affection of the Bavarian King for him that the world owes
to-day the possession of the <i lang="de">Meistersinger</i>, <i lang=
"de">Der Ring</i>, and <i>Parsifal</i>. His help at a time when it was
most needed, gave back to the master his strength and courage.
Ludwig&rsquo;s magnificent generosity enabled him to create these new
and glorious works. Moreover, the royal protection did much further to
attract attention to Wagner and to the music of the future. His
enthusiastic admiration for the composer of <i>Rienzi</i>, <i lang=
"de">Der Fliegende Holl&auml;nder</i>, <i lang=
"de">Tannh&auml;user</i>, <i>Lohengrin</i>, <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>,
and the above-mentioned operas, has caused the name of Ludwig II. to be
honourably connected with the history of music.</p>
<p class="par">Little more than twenty years have passed since his
death, in the year 1886. But the prophetic words which he uttered on
the 4th of August 1865, in a letter to Richard Wagner, have become
reality. &ldquo;When we two are no more, our work will serve as a
shining model for posterity. It will delight centuries. And hearts will
glow with enthusiasm for the art which is from God, and is
everlasting.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Political Situation&mdash;The Schleswig-Holstein
Question&mdash;The War of 1866</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The sixties were in political respects a time
fraught with fate for the German people.</p>
<p class="par">The future Emperor Wilhelm I.&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang=
"de">der Siegeskaiser</i>,&rdquo; as he was called&mdash;had in 1861
succeeded his romantic, and in the end, insane brother, Friedrich
Wilhelm IV., as King of Prussia. The year afterwards Bismarck was
constituted the leader of Prussian politics. He had long borne within
him the scheme for the federation of the German states under the
Prussian sceptre; and his political watch-word was, as we know,
&ldquo;iron and blood.&rdquo; In 1863 an opportunity occurred for the
great statesman to take the first step on his projected way. The Danish
King, Frederik VII., had died, and as a consequence of this the
Schleswig-Holstein question had peremptorily come to the fore. Bismarck
invited the hereditary enemy, Austria, to go hand in hand with Prussia
in her war against Denmark. In the situation brought about by this war
the position of the medium-sized and small states of Germany became
serious, and the neutrality which they had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>adopted
became more and more untenable. Bavaria had kept outside the struggle
in the Schleswig-Holstein question. Its then reigning Monarch,
Maximilian II., had made an attempt to negotiate between the
conflicting parties, and shortly before his death endeavoured to
mediate in favour of the Duke of Agustenborg&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p class="par">Matters had by this time entered on a new stage: the two
great powers could not agree as to the prize gained by the conquest.
Dark storm-clouds gathered, threatening a more far-reaching and bloody
issue than the Schleswig-Holstein one. Ludwig II. desired to take up
the thankless part of peacemaker, and follow in his father&rsquo;s
footsteps. This was of no avail, for Bismarck wished for a decision of
the question whether Prussia or Austria should play first violin, and a
war was a necessary link in his scheme. Bavaria in general, and the
King in particular, seem long to have considered it possible that the
storm might abate without the shedding of blood. Nevertheless he issued
orders on the 10th of May, 1866, for the mobilisation of the Bavarian
army.</p>
<p class="par">On the 22nd of May, at Schloss Hohenschwangau, one of
the Ministers held a lecture before him on the position of affairs.
Ludwig went a turn in the park with his counsellor, and parted from him
with manifestations of friendliness, after having offered him a cigar.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>The Minister had hardly taken his departure before
Ludwig mounted a horse, and rode off, accompanied by a single groom. He
galloped to the railway station of Biessenhofen, reached Lindau
unrecognised, and passed thence unnoticed into Switzerland. The journey
concerned Richard Wagner, who was living at his villa
&ldquo;Triebchen,&rdquo; close to Lucerne, and whom he wished to
congratulate on the occasion of his birthday. The Landsturm was
meanwhile about to be called out in Bavaria, and the King&rsquo;s
signature was required. Not a syllable as to his intended excursion had
crossed his lips while he had been talking to the Minister. When the
latter again returned to Hohenschwangau, his Majesty had disappeared.
Inquiries were made; but no one knew whither he had ridden, or how long
he intended to be away. After a time tracks were found leading to the
lake of Lucerne, and it was discovered that two riders, late at night,
had been admitted to Richard Wagner&rsquo;s villa. There was no longer
any doubt as to where he was to be sought. The Premier telegraphed to
Wagner that the King&rsquo;s presence in Bavaria was necessary. Ludwig
at once went back to Lindau, whither the royal train was sent to meet
him. It is true that he had been absent only a few days, but not
without reason this excursion was looked upon with great disfavour. His
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1194" title=
"Source: gratituous">gratuitous</span> disappearance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>at such
a critical moment was commented on and criticised in foreign and
Bavarian newspapers. The only circumstance to explain and excuse his
conduct was his youthful confidence that his kingdom would not be
involved in the struggle.</p>
<p class="par">On the 27th of May he opened the Chamber in person,
expressing in the Speech from the Throne the hope, which he would not
yet relinquish, that Germany might be spared a sister war. This was,
however, on the eve of breaking out.</p>
<p class="par">The sympathies of Bavaria were on the side of Austria,
and on the 14th of June a military alliance was concluded with that
country. The same day Prussia declared in Dresden, Hanover, and Cassel
its ultimatum: Alliance or war! The Grand Duke of Hesse, who would not
allow Prussia &ldquo;to put a pistol to his breast,&rdquo; was a
Prussian prisoner of state five days later. King George of Hanover
declared himself, &ldquo;as a Christian, a monarch, and a
Guelph,&rdquo; to be against Prussia. But so rapid was the Prussian
advance that the Hanoverian troops surrendered without conditions on
the 29th of June, in spite of their victory at Langensalza.</p>
<p class="par">On the 16th of June the war broke out in Bavaria.
Austria had undertaken, in an agreement with this country, not to
conclude <span class="corr" id="xd21e1205" title=
"Source: pleace">peace</span> on her own account. On the 25th of June
Ludwig went for a day to the headquarters of the army, at Bamberg. He
issued a proclamation to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>troops, in which he said, &ldquo;I do
not bid you farewell; my thoughts will be with you,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He left the command of the army to his father&rsquo;s
uncle, Field Marshal Prince Karl, then seventy-one years of age, who,
together with Prince Alexander of Hesse, led the troops of Bavaria,
W&uuml;rtemberg, Baden-Baden, and Hesse&mdash;the so-called
<i>reichs-arm&eacute;e</i>, which consisted of nearly a hundred
thousand men. In spite of his bravery and his military experience from
the wars of Napoleon the Great, in which he had taken part, Prince Karl
could do nothing against the dissensions of the allied troops, which
hastened the enemy&rsquo;s victory. The Prussians conquered the
<i>reichs-arm&eacute;e</i> in a number of small battles.</p>
<p class="par">Inactive, powerless, Ludwig was witness from his capital
of the defeat of his faithful soldiers. His people were a vanquished
people, and himself a vanquished King. Austria concluded peace with
Prussia in Nikolsburg without paying any regard to the fate of her
ally. Bavaria now also concluded peace. She did not lose any province,
had only to renounce a strip of country hardly worth mentioning; but
she was compelled to pay thirty millions of guldens for the expenses of
the war. The Bavarian troops went each in their own direction. The war
had lasted a month, but this month had been long enough to lay fields
and woods bare, and to fill thousands of hearts with loss and sorrow.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The King makes the Tour of his Kingdom</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A couple of months after peace had been concluded
Ludwig made the tour of his kingdom&mdash;the first and the last of his
reign.</p>
<p class="par">He appeared with great brilliance, his suite consisting
of no less than a hundred and nineteen persons. Although the war had
brought Bavaria neither honour nor advantage, and although the King had
taken no active part in it, he was everywhere received with the
greatest rejoicings. The enthusiasm he aroused was so great, that his
journey literally resembled a triumphal progress, and this conquered
and peaceful monarch might have taken to himself C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
celebrated words: <i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The sympathy of the people during the war of 1866 had
been markedly on the side upon which the Government had placed itself,
namely, that of Austria. The young King&rsquo;s personality was,
moreover, as if created to awaken interest and devotion. He was
twenty-one years of age. He united to his youth a beauty which was
widely celebrated. Nearly every illustrated paper in Germany, nay, the
whole of Europe, published a picture of him at that time, and to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>these was added a text redundant with admiration
and praise. The romantic light which rested on him, the legends current
as to his gifts and his intellect, his &aelig;sthetic and artistic
tastes, even the many half-true half-fictitious stories of his caprices
and peculiarities&mdash;all contributed to increase the interest taken
in him. Added to this was the fact that this official journey was for
the purpose of making acquaintance with the wounds caused by the war,
and in order, as far as possible, to bring healing and relief to
them.</p>
<p class="par">It was a winter journey. The snow lay like a white
coverlet over the afflicted provinces traversed by the railway. But
from behind the wide plate-glass windows Ludwig saw, whenever a group
of houses came into sight, that a flag was hoisted on every roof and
that from every window a hearty welcome was being waved to him. The
noise of the train was put to naught by the jubilant clangour of the
village trumpets and clarionets. In the towns the reception was on a
grander scale, and not less hearty. All the streets were decorated with
flags and banners, and all the bells were pealing. The sounds of
cannon, music, and cries of hurrah mingled one with another. The
Monarch was the recipient of loyal speeches, verses, state dinners, and
parades of troops. Concerts and balls were given in his honour. Young
girls with awed admiration presented him with nosegays. The poor and
the rich, the young and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>old, gave proof-positive of their
devotion by the zeal and impatience with which they sought to approach
him. The joy of the people broke through police-guards and etiquette.
Everyone asked to welcome this conquered man who was making a triumphal
progress though the conquered provinces. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; a
Bavarian officer who was with him told me&mdash;&ldquo;never was a King
worshipped as was Ludwig on his tour in his own country.&rdquo; The
jubilations were equally deafening, the heartiness just as spontaneous,
in Bayreuth, in Bamberg, Hof, Schweinfurt, Kissingen, Aschaffenburg,
W&uuml;rzburg, and Nuremberg.</p>
<p class="par">The snowstorms now and then reduced a plan to nothing;
Ludwig&rsquo;s health sometimes failed and prevented him from enjoying
the festivities as much as he might have done; he was unable now and
then to appear at some entertainment which had been given in his
honour. But he was never-failing in his amiability, and he visited all
the places where there had been battles with the enemy, laying flowers
with his own hand on the soldiers&rsquo; graves, and rewarding those
who had helped to nurse the wounded.</p>
<p class="par">On the 30th of November he arrived in the most glorious
winter weather at Nuremberg, welcomed by crowds of people and shouts of
&ldquo;Long live the King!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the evening the citizens gave a brilliant ball; it
was so numerously attended that it was only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>with
difficulty space could be kept for the dancers. Nevertheless, Ludwig
danced for four hours running. He conversed with ladies of all ages,
and with men of the most varying grades of society. He was pushed into
the very midst of the crowd, and he laughed and joked at the incident.
It was not till long after midnight that he withdrew from the ball. He
remained a whole week in Nuremberg. The castle courtyard, and the
neighbouring castle hill, were besieged by people from morning to
night, who could not look often enough on their King. From the adjacent
country places people came in troops to the town; and every day he gave
audience in the hall of the Kaiserburg.</p>
<p class="par">Throughout the journey magnificent gifts of money poured
out of the privy purse for the assuaging of poverty and need. Criminals
were pardoned, and the countless petitions which were sent in were
nearly all granted. The police endeavoured to keep the obtrusive
supplicants away. But the Monarch had a sharp eye for that which it was
desired to keep from him. He discovered for himself among the crowds of
people the pale and careworn forms who hung together with petitions in
their hands, and he would then send one of his equerries to find out
the nature of their wishes. Wearing a field-marshal&rsquo;s uniform he
held a review of the troops on the Ludwigsmark, and sewed with his own
hand the war memorial on four standards. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>The general in command
made a speech in his honour, after which the troops broke out into
vociferous cheering.</p>
<p class="par">In response to a special invitation Prince Otto joined
him at Nuremberg; the interest of the inhabitants from this moment was
divided between the two brothers. Otto also was genial with all with
whom he came in contact. He was handsome; and he was the possessor of a
gay and lively temperament, in which his brother was wanting.</p>
<p class="par">At last the end came of the royal days in Nuremberg. On
the afternoon of the 10th of December the King, accompanied by his
brother, left the town. He promised soon to repeat the visit&mdash;a
promise which was never fulfilled! Despite the demonstrations of love
and devotion which were so often and so unstintingly lavished on him by
the population, he never again during his reign of twenty-two years
travelled in his kingdom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">Ludwig&rsquo;s Betrothal</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At a court ball which took place during one of the
first years of Ludwig&rsquo;s reign, he said to one of his
gentlemen-in-waiting: &ldquo;There are many pretty women at my court,
are there not?&rdquo; and added, as his glance full of tenderness
sought the Queen-mother, &ldquo;but my mother is the prettiest of them,
and the one whom I admire most.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Queen Marie had many good qualities, but though her sons
both loved her, she had no lasting influence on them. She hardly took
the trouble to try to enter into Ludwig&rsquo;s train of thought, or to
hide his weaknesses and peculiarities from others, nor does she seem to
have had the ability to understand his strange and composite
nature.</p>
<p class="par">As we are aware, the young King took great interest in
art and literature. At the beginning of his reign he endeavoured to
influence the Queen&rsquo;s taste; but when he talked to her about
books, inquired her opinion of this or that work, she would usually
answer: &ldquo;I never read anything!&mdash;I cannot understand why
people should always want to be reading.&rdquo; Ludwig regarded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>her want of understanding as an indirect reproach
to himself; and his disappointment in her had a depressing effect upon
him. Both mother and son were fond of a country life. Both had a
particular affection for Hohenschwangau. The Queen-mother had spent her
happy married life at this place: the King&rsquo;s best childish
memories were connected with the castle. But even this similarity of
taste gave rise to disagreements. Whereas Ludwig infinitely preferred
to be alone at Hohenschwangau, the Queen-mother preferred to collect
people around her. While her thrifty mind was able to content itself
with a bunch of Alpine roses, picked by herself, the King required
gardens and parks, created by art. Life within the family circle,
however, went on in very much the same manner as in the lifetime of her
husband: Queen Marie retained her housewifely habits, and the King and
Prince Otto shared her life at the royal summer residences in the
vicinity of the capital.</p>
<p class="par">King Maximilian had built a Swiss ch&acirc;let,
&ldquo;Pleckenau,&rdquo; some little distance above the
Marienbr&uuml;cke, and about five miles from Hohenschwangau. During the
first years of her widowhood Queen Marie regularly used this house as a
resting-place on her trips in the neighbourhood, and as an object for
small excursions. Ludwig and Otto, with their attendants, would come
out and spend quiet evenings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>with her. The King&rsquo;s nineteenth
birthday was celebrated at Pleckenau. A meal was partaken of in the
garden, and the utmost gaiety prevailed. &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo;
said the Queen, &ldquo;something is wanting to increase the pleasure of
the day.&rdquo; She looked inquiringly round the circle to see if no
one guessed her thoughts. As she nodded at the same time to Ludwig, he
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mean music, mamma! We will have some
later!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I mean something else,&rdquo; answered his
mother, &ldquo;something that we want particularly to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Prince Otto, then sixteen years old, suddenly called
out:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I know, mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your spinning-wheel!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Those present were vastly entertained at the
Prince&rsquo;s answer, for the Queen-mother&rsquo;s weakness for
practical occupations was the object of much amusement. This time,
however, her thoughts had carried her in another direction. She
confided to the circle that she had been thinking of a
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> for the King.</p>
<p class="par">Despite Ludwig&rsquo;s youth, not only his mother, but
also his people had begun to occupy themselves with the emotional side
of his nature. His love of the mountains and their solitude had caused
a rumour to become current that a postmaster&rsquo;s or ranger&rsquo;s
daughter in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>Schliersee had taken possession of his heart. This
report was entirely without foundation. Apart from his mother and her
court ladies, his old nurse and his governess, he had before his
accession hardly come in contact with women. As the young King he was
amiable and courteous, but exceedingly retiring in his behaviour
towards them. It was perhaps for the very reason of this retiring
attitude that he set flame to a countless number of hearts. Many ladies
wore lockets containing some souvenir of him; such, for instance, as a
flower his foot had trodden on, or some of the hairs of his
riding-horse.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1298src" href="#xd21e1298"
name="xd21e1298src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Some years passed by after the above-mentioned birthday
party took place, and still the wish of the Queen-mother and the people
was ungratified. The Empress of Russia&rsquo;s matrimonial project had
become known, had been much discussed, and had again been nearly
forgotten. The King was now twenty-two years of age.</p>
<p class="par">The world was at this juncture surprised by the
announcement that he was engaged to be married to his cousin, the
Duchess Sophie Charlotte. She was young, pretty, well-educated, very
musical, and the possessor of a fine voice. In defiance of the feeling
against him which prevailed at court, she had openly shown her
admiration for Richard Wagner, and was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>usually present at the
Hof Theater when his works were performed. Ludwig looked forward to
finding in her an ally in the struggle for his friend. Although the
cousins were on a friendly footing, their mutual relations had never
given any ground to suppose that a matrimonial alliance between them
would ever come about. The evening before the report was circulated
there had been a ball in the &ldquo;Museum,&rdquo; at which Ludwig had
been present. The young ladies belonging to the court had been
remarkable for their charming dresses. Sophie, in particular, had
displayed all the magic of her beauty.</p>
<p class="par">At six o&rsquo;clock the next morning the King hastened
to his mother, and requested her, in his name, to ask the
Duchess&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p class="par">Queen Marie had since her marriage been on terms of warm
friendship with the young Duchess&rsquo;s parents and their family. She
was pleased at her son&rsquo;s prompt decision. She drove in the early
morning hours to the palace of Duke Max and the Duchess Ludovica.
Nothing had occurred to prepare the Duke or his wife for what was about
to happen, but they were proud at the unexpected offer of marriage. One
of their daughters was an empress,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1311src"
href="#xd21e1311" name="xd21e1311src">2</a> they had seen another of
their daughters a queen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1314src" href=
"#xd21e1314" name="xd21e1314src">3</a>; now the youngest of them, and
the one nearest her mother&rsquo;s heart, would have her place on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>throne of Bavaria. The young Duchess, too, gave
her consent without hesitation. Eye-witnesses have, however, declared
that her face, otherwise so fresh, became exceedingly pale when she
promised the Queen-mother to marry her son. At nine o&rsquo;clock
Ludwig himself arrived. An hour later the formal engagement was
celebrated.</p>
<p class="par">The news, which was rapidly spread through the capital
on this morning, became certainty in the evening. On the 22nd of
January, 1867, there was given at the Hof Theater a new play by
Benedix. The King was present at the performance. After the conclusion
of the first act, the Queen-mother came in. She and her son walked
across to the ducal box, where Sophie was sitting with her youngest
brother, and together they fetched the young girl to the
&ldquo;Imperial box,&rdquo; where she seated herself between the two.
There are still alive in Munich elderly persons who remember the
memorable night when the Princess walked in on Ludwig&rsquo;s arm, and
gracefully bowed to the public.</p>
<p class="par">The Duchess was born on the 22nd of February, 1847. She
was often to be seen in the Bavarian national costume, which was very
becoming to her; and she was considered by many to be better-looking
than the Empress Elizabeth, who was celebrated for her beauty. A light
blue dress of silk clung this evening to her slender figure. Her hair,
which was almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>too thick and abundant, was dressed in plaits. Her
face was radiant and pure. A pair of unfathomable blue eyes, with dark
lashes, looked up at the King.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th of January the engagement was officially
announced to the Chamber, which voted an address of congratulation. It
concluded with the following words: &ldquo;May all the blessings which
a married life can give grow forth in abundance from the alliance which
it is your Majesty&rsquo;s intention to contract, to the happiness of
your Majesty, to the prosperity of the royal house, to the blessing of
the country!&rdquo; The deputation was not granted an audience; it had
to content itself with congratulating Ludwig and his betrothed on the
6th of February at a court ball.</p>
<p class="par">The country was surprised at the King&rsquo;s choice; no
one could understand why he had so suddenly taken this decision. The
news was received with sympathy, but at first without real enthusiasm.
The three former Kings of Bavaria had had Protestant wives, and the
Protestant part of the population would have preferred Ludwig to make a
similar choice. In the capital itself, however, people were very well
satisfied. As he had in no way been influenced, and as there could be
no political grounds for a marriage with a member of the royal house,
it was assumed that inclination alone had dictated his proposal; and
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>assumption seemed in accord with his leaning
towards the romantic. It was hoped, moreover, that the marriage would
chase away his love of solitude, which had already begun to show
itself, and also that the court would gain in brilliancy.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig understood how to throw glamour on his alliance;
and, little by little, people began to show interest in his bride.
Double portraits of the young couple were to be seen everywhere; and
men and women of the populace would stand for hours in pouring rain to
catch a glimpse of the Duchess. During the Carnival the young Monarch
gave a series of balls; and on the 28th of February the engaged couple
were present at an entertainment given in their honour by the Minister
of the Royal House and of Foreign Affairs, Prince Hohenlohe. On the
23rd of March they took part in a masquerade at the Casino.</p>
<p class="par">The King appointed the 12th of October as the day of his
wedding; both his father and grandfather had been married on that day.
On the occasion of Maximilian II.&rsquo;s marriage, a respectable
couple in poor circumstances, chosen from each of the provinces of the
kingdom, had been given 1000 guldens from the royal exchequer. It was
decided that a similar sum should be distributed on Ludwig&rsquo;s
marriage. In all circles of society and all parts of the kingdom
wedding presents were in course <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>of preparation. The city of
Munich built a coach decorated with cupids, which cost 100,000 guldens.
The Palatinate sent some fine horses from the noted stud of
Zweibr&uuml;cken, and a cask of noble wine. In the royal Palace the
so-called garden suite was fitted up for the reception of the future
Queen. This had formerly been used by Ludwig I. and Maximilian II.; but
Ludwig intended to retain his old apartments, which were situated above
those destined for Sophie. The painted ceiling in the vestibule, which
dates from the seventeenth century, was tastefully restored; and the
Palace was soon brilliant with truly royal lustre. In the chief
workshops of the city workmen were designing, hammering, carving, and
forging household utensils and articles of ornament. Commemorative
medals were struck bearing the heads of the King and his bride, and the
most skilful engravers of the country drew the young Duchess, in order
that her picture might be spread abroad on the marriage day in hundreds
of thousands of copies.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig I. was still alive: the news of the betrothal
reached him in Italy. He was pleased at this marriage between his
sister&rsquo;s youngest daughter and his grandson. Shortly before he
had seen at Pompeii a fresco depicting Venus and Adonis, and having
thought to find a likeness between Ludwig and the beautiful youth, he
now embodied his idea and good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72"
href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>wishes in some verses which
referred to the aforesaid picture. They conclude thus:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Des Lebens H&ouml;chstes haben sie erworben.</p>
<p class="line">Nie werde durch die Welt dein Gl&uuml;ck verdorben,</p>
<p class="line">Nie heisse es: die Liebe ist gestorben!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The King had asked the hand of his cousin in a
moment of infatuation; but it was not the fire of his senses which
burned within him: his feelings were the joy of the artist at the sight
of beauty. More than one trustworthy chronicler of the events of this
time has hinted that the Duchess had a serious inclination for another,
and that it was the desire of her parents for the marriage with her
cousin which influenced her decision in favour of it. Although Ludwig
was hardly her first love it was impossible that she could have been
insensible to his beauty, which fascinated all women, or to the charm
of his manner and personality when in his best moods. All who knew
Sophie as a girl speak enthusiastically of her liveliness and buoyancy.
Her goodness of heart was also praised, though this did not exclude a
light vein of mockery. She was gay; but she was, nevertheless, haughty
and proud, and there is hardly any ground to doubt that she was tempted
by the brilliance of a royal crown.</p>
<p class="par">Early in the spring the ducal family went out to
Possenhofen, and Ludwig at the same time took up his residence at the
ch&acirc;teau of Berg. His little yacht, the <i>Tristan</i>, often bore
him to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>the house of his betrothed, where he was in the
habit of spending the evenings. He showered costly presents on Sophie.
Every morning the royal lover rode round the Starnberger See to offer
her in person a bunch of roses. If he came too early he gave the
bouquet to her waiting-maid; and on the way back from his ride, stopped
to see the Duchess. Thus weeks and months passed by. The idyll had not
apparently suffered any break. It was Ludwig&rsquo;s hope that his
future wife would be the friend of his loneliness. He talked often to
her of Richard Wagner, whom he loved so dearly. He recited to her
poems, ancient and modern, and scenes from Schiller&rsquo;s dramatic
works. She listened at first with pleasure to his declamations and
outpourings; but at length grew tired of them. The King was of a
suspicious nature; he suspected Sophie and himself. He sent her notes
and presents in the middle of the night, exacting long letters of
thanks by the returning messenger. If she forgot to fulfil a single
wish of his he was sulky for days. Unwarrantable fits of violence
alternated with profound melancholy. He suffered from headache; and his
excited nerves required solitude. After the intoxication of the first
few weeks was past, his betrothed saw in him a total stranger. His
extraordinary caprices gave her anxiety; and his intellectual life was
a closed book to her superficial nature. If she was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>wanting
in the ability to follow his flights of fancy, he on his side was
incapable of satisfying her need for love. There was in the whole of
this connection something which was artificial, and which did not ring
true. The Duchess had a hasty temper. The restless state of mind
induced in her by his changing moods made her capricious and unable to
govern herself. Misunderstandings which at first had gone unheeded,
began to arise between the young couple; disagreements separated them
still more from one another. Long before Sophie knew for certain that
the engagement would be broken off, a presentiment must have warned her
that it could not possibly endure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"

<h2 class="main">The King goes to Paris&mdash;Disharmonies between the
Engaged Couple&mdash;Ludwig meets the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress
Eug&eacute;nie in Augsburg&mdash;The King breaks his Promise of
Marriage</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the midst of the preparations for the wedding
the King made several journeys. At the beginning of June he went with
Prince Otto to Eisenach, in order to see Wartburg. Later in the summer
he went to Paris, where an International Exhibition was going on.</p>
<p class="par">The Paris paper <i lang="fr">La Situation</i> had long
in advance announced that the King of Bavaria would visit that city.
His arrival was looked upon as an event which might be of political
importance. Although he at once paid a visit at the Tuileries, he made
no secret of the fact that he had come to France as a private
gentleman, and wished to preserve the strictest incognito. The Empress
Eug&eacute;nie was in England; but Napoleon received him as an honoured
and welcome guest. He invited him to his magnificently restored palace
in the Bois de Compi&egrave;gne, where a review of troops was held in
his honour. At the lunch which followed this there were present the
King of Portugal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>and Prince Anton of Hohenzollern-Siegmaringen and
his son, the Hereditary Prince Leopold, whose candidature for the
Spanish throne three years later caused Napoleon to risk his crown.</p>
<p class="par">The King of Bavaria appreciated but little the pleasures
of the Imperial court. He spent the greater number of his evenings at
the &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Grand Opera</span>&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">The&acirc;tre Lyrique</span>.&rdquo; The chief
part of the day he spent in the Exhibition, where the sections devoted
to art and education particularly attracted his attention. It was his
design to remain in the French capital until the Empress
Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s return. His visit was, however, cut short by the
news that his father&rsquo;s brother Otto, the former King of Greece,
had died at the castle of Bamberg, where he had passed his latter
years. Ludwig hurried back to Munich, and was present on the 30th of
July at his uncle&rsquo;s interment.</p>
<p class="par">The business houses of the capital were meanwhile at
work on wedding gifts for their King. Letters and presents continued to
be exchanged between the engaged couple; and nothing hinted to the
outer world that storm-clouds had arisen. In the month of August
Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie came from Paris to Salzburg, to meet the
Emperor and Empress of Austria. They stopped a day in Augsburg.
Napoleon in his youth had been a pupil at the College of St Anna in
that town, and wished to revisit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77"
href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>well-known spots. Ludwig met the
Emperor and Empress at Augsburg and accompanied them to Munich, where
the Queen-mother received the august travellers. The tie between the
engaged couple seemed far as yet from being loosened; the King
presented Sophie to the Empress, who heartily kissed both the young
people.</p>
<p class="par">Still Ludwig continued his rides along the shores of the
lake of Starnberg.</p>
<p class="par">One morning he stopped earlier than usual outside
Possenhofen with his bunch of flowers. As usual he went up to the
ground floor of the castle. At the top step he met a lady&rsquo;s-maid,
who rushed past him, and at the same moment a washing-basin was flung
after the fugitive. The water streamed out of it just as his Majesty
was setting his foot on the threshold. Near-sighted as he was, Ludwig
nevertheless saw who was the cause of this scene: his betrothed, who
rapidly disappeared behind the next door, looked at this moment more
like a Fury than a Venus! He stood a moment aghast; then hurried down,
swung himself into the saddle, and rode rapidly away. He was expected
in vain that evening at Possenhofen.</p>
<p class="par">Judging by the later development of Ludwig&rsquo;s
character, it is probable that a marriage between him and Sophie would
never have come about. The scene above described meanwhile hastened on
the break. Autumn was at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>hand, and the day appointed for the
marriage drawing near. The wedding coach was ready, eight splendid
horses having been bought to draw it. The new Queen&rsquo;s court had
been appointed. The programme of the marriage ceremonies had been made
out by the court officials and submitted to his Majesty for approval.
All the preparations respecting the court entertainments and popular
rejoicings with which the alliance was to be celebrated had been
made.</p>
<p class="par">Then one day in September the Minister of the Royal
House and Foreign Affairs, Prince Hohenlohe, received a letter in the
royal handwriting.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1397src" href=
"#xd21e1397" name="xd21e1397src">1</a> &ldquo;Here is some news for
you,&rdquo; said he to his secretary, handing him the letter. Ludwig
briefly informed the Minister that he had decided not to marry the
Duchess. He left it to the Prince&rsquo;s well-known diplomacy to
arrange the matter to mutual satisfaction. Hohenlohe at once asked for
an audience with the King; but he was informed that his Majesty had
left for the highlands a quarter of an hour earlier; his plans were
unknown, and his return uncertain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This,&rdquo; observed the Prince, shrugging his
shoulders, &ldquo;is evidently a fixed determination. At any rate, it
is better than setting me a year hence to bring about a
separation.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But there is absolutely no reason for the
King&rsquo;s step,&rdquo; remarked the secretary.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For that very reason matters must be arranged in
such a manner that she may find a pretext for withdrawing. Go at once
to the mint and order them to stop striking the marriage medal,&rdquo;
answered Hohenlohe resolutely.</p>
<p class="par">It was first officially announced that the day of the
wedding was postponed, but that the alliance was by no means broken
off. Duke Max asked in the name of his daughter when the marriage was
to take place; and on his request that a time should be appointed, was
informed that &ldquo;this was impossible on account of the King&rsquo;s
state of health.&rdquo; The answer gave the ducal house a reasonable
pretext for declaring that they would &ldquo;in such circumstances
prefer to consider the engagement at an end.&rdquo; The King received
this declaration &ldquo;with the deepest regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The rupture was hardly so unexpected by the general
public as the engagement had been; for, thanks to Hohenlohe&rsquo;s
care, the public mind had been prepared. Nevertheless, the event was
for long a standing subject of conversation. Opportunity had been given
for the most varied surmises, and stories and hints were not lacking.
Some sought the reason in a mutual want of sympathy. Others knew
better, affirmed that the Duchess loved another, and that the King had
discovered this fact. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But all were loath to think that their beloved Ludwig
was in any way to blame in the matter.</p>
<p class="par">Sophie&rsquo;s reputation was hardly treated. Gossips
and court sycophants threw suspicion on her. Disparaging and marvellous
accounts of her conduct were circulated, and were never lived down. It
is little to the King&rsquo;s honour that he never took any step
whatever to do justice to the woman he had wished to make his wife and
the Queen of his kingdom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">After the Parting with Sophie&mdash;Episodes from the
King&rsquo;s Excursions in the Highlands</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Though Ludwig&rsquo;s initiative had dictated the
rupture with Sophie, it is certain that at the end the parting was not
easy to him, and that it was not without influence on his future life.
A marked change in his manner took place from this time.</p>
<p class="par">Immediately after this event he retired to his most
secluded castle. He was free, but he was not happy. He became more
suspicious and shy than before; and it was plain to all that he was
harassed by inward disquiet. His good relations with the ducal house
were, of course, destroyed. He had not a single real friend, not one
person in his <i>entourage</i> with whom he could talk confidentially.
The break cast a deep shadow even over his relations with his mother.
She avoided him, in her disappointment and anger, instead of
endeavouring to win his confidence and help him in his mental
struggles, and his love of solitude increased with his bitterness at
her coldness.</p>
<p class="par">Duties, however, called him back to his capital; by New
Year 1868 he was again in Munich. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82"
href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>The people showed signs of
pleasure at having him amongst them once more; the windows of the
Residenz were lighted up on the dark winter evenings, crowds of the
curious besieged the entrances, admired the vestibules and staircases,
which were filled with flowers, and listened to the music as they
caught snatches of it from inside.</p>
<p class="par">The King was holding court; he gave concerts and balls.
The festivities, however, were short-lived: Ludwig I. died at Nice. All
entertainments were cancelled; and again the troubled man was able to
retire from the world. Those, and there were many, who desired an
audience of him were compelled to put their patience to the proof, and
in the end the greater number of these aspirants had to take their
departure without having been granted one. Even here, in retirement, he
was unaccountable. He refused foreign potentates the sight of his
magnificent palaces and winter gardens; but took round one of them a
Swiss student, and showed him all its beauties. He was caprice itself,
unaccountable as the most changeable of women. One day he would be
affable, the next inaccessible and silent. These qualities, however,
were chiefly apparent in his relations with the heads of society. Among
the peasantry he was amiable and straightforward; and he retained his
popularity among the working classes to the end of his reign. The
country people round about those places where he chiefly resided to
this day tell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>many charming stories of him. Thus a gentleman who
was touring in the mountains came one day to Hohenschwangau. As he was
wandering about in the vicinity of the castle he saw a young man coming
towards him. The latter wore a short black coat, had a Tyrolese hat on
his head, and carried a large fish in his hand. The stranger took him
for a gardener, and asked him if it was possible to see over the
castle.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the King is there no one dares to enter
it,&rdquo; answered the young man; &ldquo;but as he is not there just
now, I can show you round if you wish.&rdquo; The offer was naturally
accepted with gratitude. The fictitious gardener very obligingly showed
the stranger through the apartments, where all the servants bowed
respectfully. They stopped before the King&rsquo;s bed-chamber, the
young man explaining that visitors were not allowed to enter it. After
they had seen everything, he took a complaisant farewell of the
stranger, who concluded by asking where his Majesty was at the
time.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The King was in the castle when we went over
it,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And we did not see him?&rdquo; exclaimed the
gentleman in surprise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You did see him. I am the King!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">One day when Ludwig was walking alone in the mountains
he met a goat-herd. &ldquo;I am going to drive my goats home,&rdquo;
said the boy, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know what time it is.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you no watch?&rdquo; asked the King.
&ldquo;How could I have a watch?&rdquo; answered the child. Ludwig told
him, smiling, what the hour was, and the day afterwards sent him a
watch as a present.</p>
<p class="par">When on his lonely drives he often passed through a
village where he had noticed a cottage belonging to a shoemaker. The
man was always to be found tending his flowers in the little patch of
garden. One day Ludwig stopped the carriage outside the village and
walked to the shoemaker&rsquo;s, where he remained outside the fence
watching the man, who was busy in his garden.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are not quite
successful with your lilies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the shoemaker, who did not
recognise the King; &ldquo;I have not grudged work or expense these
five years to get pure white lilies, but they always have a green tinge
about them. If I could only get into the royal garden&mdash;I hear they
have such beautiful white lilies there!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It would not be any help to you, master,&rdquo;
said Ludwig, &ldquo;for it is hardly your intention to steal plants
there, I think. Nor would you have the opportunity of doing
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you think of me, good sir?&rdquo;
exclaimed the man indignantly. &ldquo;Do you think I would touch my
King&rsquo;s property? All I want is to see this beautiful flower in
its full perfection.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href=
"#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You might be able to do that. I know the head
gardener, and I will put in a good word for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you would do that I would willingly make you a
pair of boots for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want no return for such a trifling
service,&rdquo; said Ludwig, taking leave of him with a friendly
nod.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning a servant brought the cobbler a large
bunch of white lilies from the King. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Sophie&rsquo;s Engagement and Marriage&mdash;An Unexpected Meeting with
the Duchesse d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on&mdash;A Last Attempt to forge the
Links of Hymen around Ludwig</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the latter half of September, 1868, the Empress
of Russia came to Munich accompanied by a numerous suite. Her
unsuccessful matrimonial project did not seem to have diminished her
interest in the Sovereign of Bavaria.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig received her with the same respect and warmth as
before, and entertained her with a magnificence the like of which had
not been seen before in his realm. He had caused the apartments in
Schloss Berg which were placed at the Empress&rsquo;s disposal to be
done up in exact similarity, according to description, to her rooms in
the Russian Palace. A state luncheon at the Palace at Munich and a
state performance at the theatre, alternated with excursions to his
castles in the vicinity of the capital.</p>
<p class="par">The Tsarina spent an evening with the royal family on
the &ldquo;Roseninsel,&rdquo; where her young friend had arranged an
Italian night with music and singing, and at which the singers of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>opera took part. The whole of the lake of
Starnberg was illuminated with Bengal lights. In the gardens and
courtyard of the ch&acirc;teau were erected allegorical statues. Every
rose-bush hid a surprise. Countless numbers of rockets were sent up
into the air above the lake, and moved, many-hued, in the wind. Music
was played on a vessel, so clothed in leafage that it resembled an
islet, and on which the inhabitants and summer visitors to Starnberg
had taken up their position, adding by their applause to the general
festivity of the entertainment. It was like a tale from the
&ldquo;Thousand and One Nights.&rdquo; The Russian Empress expressed
the opinion later that she had never experienced anything so romantic
as this evening.</p>
<p class="par">The Grand Duchess Maria did not accompany her mother on
this occasion. The King&rsquo;s engagement to his cousin, and his
breaking off of it, had convinced the Empress that, amiable as he was
as a friend, she would probably do wisely in cooling her ardour to
possess him as a son-in-law.</p>
<p class="par">There is no doubt that the broken engagement had injured
the Duchess Sophie&rsquo;s reputation; but it proved, nevertheless,
that the incident had by no means diminished her chances of making
another advantageous match. A reigning German Prince&mdash;a near
relative of the King&mdash;went in the summer of 1868 to Munich with
the intention of learning to know her, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>of
asking her hand. Another suitor had meanwhile been before him. On the
1st of July, 1868, the Duc de Nemours and his son had visited
Possenhofen; and on the 11th of July of the same year, during a visit
to Baden-Baden, the engagement of Sophie to Prince Ferdinand of
Orleans, Duc d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on was publicly announced.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1495src" href="#xd21e1495" name=
"xd21e1495src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Shortly afterwards the Prince and his father went to
England to make arrangements for the new home. The wedding took place
on the 28th of September, 1868, at eleven in the forenoon, in the royal
chapel at Possenhofen. At the marriage, which was performed by the
Abb&eacute; Haneberg, were present, besides the bride&rsquo;s parents
and brothers, the Count and Countess di Trani, the Hereditary Princess
Helene of Thurn and Taxis, and several of the Bavarian princes and
princesses, also the Duc de Nemours, with both his daughters, the Comte
de Paris, the Prince de Joinville, with his wife and son, and other
members of the house of Orleans. The Empress of Austria and the
ex-Queen of Naples, the latter with her husband, who had shortly before
visited their paternal home, had left Bavaria immediately before the
wedding.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="de">Neuesten Nachrichten</i> of Munich,
from which I have gathered these details, is silent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>on the
subject of an episode which has lately become known through Freiherr
von V&ouml;lderndorff&rsquo;s reminiscences of Prince Hohenlohe. In the
midst of the ceremony Ludwig II. suddenly appeared, accompanied by the
Empress of Russia, who was his guest at the time. His entrance had the
most painful effect on all present. The King remained for over an hour
in the home of the bride, apparently without in the least noticing the
feeling of constraint which his presence occasioned. His determination
to congratulate his former <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> on her wedding-day was
without doubt one of those momentary impulses which were continually
fluctuating in the neurotic man&rsquo;s restless mind.</p>
<p class="par">The Duc and Duchesse d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on went to
England, where they lived during the first years of their married life.
But Sophie often came back to Possenhofen. Ludwig avoided meeting her
with the greatest care. Many years later they accidentally encountered
one another at <span class="corr" id="xd21e1516" title=
"Source: Seehaupt">Seeshaupt</span> on the lake of Starnberg. An
accident had happened to his horses, and he had alighted from his
carriage and had got up beside a peasant who was driving past, in order
to return to Berg. At that juncture the Duchess Ludovica, with her
youngest daughter by her side, drove past. The King ordered the peasant
to make way for her equipage. He turned his head aside and took no
notice whatever of the ladies.</p>
<p class="par">After the marriage of the Duchess, a rumour <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>was
spread abroad that Ludwig was again about to become engaged. He made a
trip, in the strictest incognito, from Hohenschwangau to
Friedrichshafen on Bodensee, travelling under the name of &ldquo;Graf
von Schyren,&rdquo; and accompanied by a single servant. The King and
Queen of <span class="corr" id="xd21e1523" title=
"Source: W&uuml;rtemburg">W&uuml;rtemberg</span> had invited him to
visit them. Queen Olga, a Russian princess, who had relinquished with
regret the hope of seeing the Archduchess Maria Queen of Bavaria, had
at this juncture planned a new engagement. Princess Emma of
Waldeck-Pyrmont<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1526src" href="#xd21e1526"
name="xd21e1526src">2</a> was on a visit to the royal couple. The Queen
had made up her mind that this young lady, who was exceedingly musical
and a great admirer of Wagner&rsquo;s compositions, should make the
acquaintance of the King of Bavaria, with the view of a possible
matrimonial alliance between them. Ludwig appeared to be attracted by
the Princess, who in her turn was charmed with the gallant and
intellectual Monarch. The day spent at Friedrichshafen passed quickly
and pleasantly. Evening came, and Ludwig thought of returning to his
home. While he and the Princess were still sitting together at the
piano he became restless. He remarked that it was getting late, and
that the time for his departure was at hand. Almost immediately he rose
to depart. He took a warm farewell of the Princess, and a no less
hearty one of the King and Queen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1531" title="Source: W&uuml;rtemburg">W&uuml;rtemberg</span>,
promising that he would soon come again and perhaps stay longer. From
the steamer, which had been waiting for him, he waved several times to
the King and Queen, and the Princess, who were standing on the quay
looking after him.</p>
<p class="par">He never came back, however, and apparently forgot both
the charming day in Friedrichshafen and Princess Emma of
Waldeck-Pyrmont. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=

<h2 class="main">Ludwig and the Artistes of the Stage&mdash;Josephine
Schefzky</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">His subjects began to give up the hope of seeing
their King a husband. Several political parties, however, hoped that
they might be able to influence him through a mistress. Their
expectations were disappointed also in this. After the breaking-off of
his engagement, the fair sex played but a small part in the
King&rsquo;s life. He seems to have looked upon women with the same
eyes as the poet Holberg, who in one of his letters writes that he
regards them as &ldquo;pretty pictures&rdquo;&mdash;to be looked at,
but not to be touched! Those who knew Ludwig are entirely agreed that
he never felt real love for any woman, not even for his betrothed wife,
though at one time he appeared to do so. To Richard Wagner, he said at
one of their first meetings: &ldquo;You do not like women either, do
you? They are such bores!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig&rsquo;s indifference did not, however, prevent
him from feeling friendship for several women.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1547src" href="#xd21e1547" name="xd21e1547src">1</a> His artistic
interests, moreover, brought him into contact with others of them;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>and in his youth he often summoned actresses and
women-singers to his palaces in order that they might recite and sing
to him. He astonished them by his remarkable memory, for if they left
out but a single word he would immediately supply it. Not infrequently
he would himself take a part in a dialogue, and his gifts of elocution
are said to have been charming.</p>
<p class="par">Some of his experiences with the artistes whom he
invited to his palaces can hardly have contributed to increase his
respect for women. The f&ecirc;ted actress, Frau von Bulyowska,
declaimed before him at Hohenschwangau fragments of Schiller&rsquo;s
dramas. For some time he delighted in Mary Queen of Scots; he had her
engraved, he had her painted, he had her acted at the theatre. The
aforesaid actress, who had taken the part of Mary Stuart, had to stand
as model to the court painter, who made sketches of her for use in a
painting of that unfortunate Queen. Frau von Bulyowska thought this was
the outcome of an interest on Ludwig&rsquo;s side in her person; and
she unreservedly avowed her intention of seducing the young Monarch,
and of playing the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a Madame de Pompadour at his
court.</p>
<p class="par">One day, when visiting him on the Roseninsel, she
appeared in a costume which was evidently calculated to show her
outward charms in the most advantageous light. Her efforts were wasted;
the King&rsquo;s near-sighted eyes did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>even
appear to see what she was like. His Master of the Horse who
accompanied her, however, understood her intentions. The next time she
was received at the Palace in Munich, which had been recently restored.
The King complied with his visitor&rsquo;s wish to see his private
apartments. When they entered his bed-chamber the actress made a tender
attack upon his person. Ludwig freed himself from her embrace, rang the
bell for a servant, and called out: &ldquo;Frau von Bulyowska desires
her carriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She was not invited by him again. Another actress lost
his favour because, on a first visit to one of his palaces, she was
looking so attentively at his paintings that she did not hear him enter
the room, and consequently neglected to curtsey with deference.</p>
<p class="par">Mathilde Mallinger, the singer, was, on account of her
magnificent voice, for a short time the recipient of his favours; but
her ignorance of the forms of the great world soon repelled him. When
one day she asked for an audience, his Majesty answered that he
&ldquo;only knew a court singer, Mathilde Mallinger, but no lady of
that name; and therefore was unable to grant her an
audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">No artiste was for so long a time or so high in his
favour as Josephine Schefzky, one of the chief Wagner singers of her
day. She was the daughter of a court official, and it was to members
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>of the house of Wittelsbach that she owed the
means for her artistic education. Already before her appearance Ludwig
interested himself in this future star within the realms of song. Her
studies completed, she was engaged by the Royal Opera of Munich; and
after some years was appointed court singer. The King was usually
present at the opera when she appeared, and she had often, moreover,
the honour of singing privately before him, both in his capital and
when he was living at one or other of his pleasure palaces. He had
caused to be arranged in the Throne Room building of the Residenz a
winter garden, to which he had direct access from his private
apartments. Besides magnificent groups of exotics, the garden contained
a grotto, with a little cascade, and a pool deep and broad enough for
him to row on in a boat, the latter being formed like a swan. Dressed
as Lohengrin he lived here in the world of fancy, for a few moments
forgetting everything that oppressed his mind.</p>
<p class="par">His favourite singers sang fragments of Wagner&rsquo;s
operas to him from behind groups of palms. Here Josephine Schefzky sang
often. He permitted her to sail with him in his golden boat, and when
one day she had sung the love-song from <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, he
suddenly struck up the air from <i>Rigoletto</i>: &ldquo;<i lang=
"it">La donna &egrave; mobile</i>.&rdquo; This artiste, too, was vain
enough to believe that he was in love with her. Many of the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>of Munich expressed in fairly explicit terms their
belief that a <i>liaison</i> existed between them. In reality, however,
he was only her protector, who enjoyed her magnificent singing. So high
a place in his esteem as that she was credited with, it may fairly be
asserted was never hers. To his daily <i>entourage</i> he was in the
habit of announcing her visits in the following words: &ldquo;To-day
the goose Schefzky shall come and sing again.&rdquo; One night she sang
to him on the artificial lake in the winter garden. The boat was small.
An incautious movement on her part caused it to careen. The King
scrambled out of the pool with ease, though wet through. &ldquo;Pull
her out of the water,&rdquo; he called to a lacquey, as he disappeared
rapidly into his own apartments.</p>
<p class="par">Despite this occurrence, Josephine Schefzky continued to
be in his favour, and was singled out for this by his Majesty more
often than any other artiste. At his country residences she was
received and entertained almost like a royal guest. Ludwig directed
that some especially delectable viand or wine, from his kitchens or
cellar, should go back with her every time she returned to Munich from
Hohenschwangau or Berg. The servants, who saw that their master
esteemed her, were at great trouble to curry favour with her in their
own behalf. The royal carriage which took her away was invariably
stuffed with hams, delicate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>sausages and pat&eacute;s, with
champagne and Rhine wine, so that people at the railway station might
have supposed that the departing lady was about to journey to a place
where there was a famine. On one occasion the royal carriage even broke
down under the weight of the gifts.</p>
<p class="par">Josephine Schefzky was permitted to give the King
presents on his birthday. He received them with evident pleasure, but
only on the condition that the sum she had expended on them should be
refunded to her out of the privy purse. On an occasion of the kind she
had asked to be allowed the honour of giving him a tablecloth. The
permission was granted. Ludwig expressed in appreciative words his
admiration of the singer&rsquo;s good taste, and sent her an amiable
letter of thanks. There had been at this time a change in the
<i>personnel</i> administering the privy purse. At the head of it there
was now a near relative of the shopkeeper where Fr&auml;ulein Schefzky
had purchased her tablecloth; he had by chance heard how much she had
paid for it. The lady made her appearance some days later, and demanded
a larger sum than the gift had cost her. The official greatly wished
his master to become aware of her avarice, and after some
circumlocution informed Ludwig how the artiste had enriched herself by
means of his present. Generous as he was the King would probably have
forgiven the deception, but he was angered when he heard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>that
Fr&auml;ulein Schefzky was in the habit of asking for money from the
privy purse in the following words: &ldquo;I have spoken to him about
it!&rdquo; His vanity and self-esteem could not bear his person being
spoken of without due respect. This <i>him</i>, with which in her broad
South-German accent she denoted his Majesty, sealed her fall.</p>
<p class="par">In an autograph letter her protector of many years
informed her that she was dismissed from the court opera of Munich, and
that her salary for the unexpired time of her engagement would be paid
to her at once. The title &ldquo;Royal Bavarian Court Singer,&rdquo;
was taken away from her.</p>
<p class="par">Herewith the connection was severed. Several years
later, however, she was permitted to enter once more into
correspondence with Ludwig. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">Prince Hohenlohe&mdash;Political Frictions</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Bavaria had escaped comparatively easily from the
war of 1866. Bismarck had had good reasons for this end: that astute
statesman foresaw the approaching war with France, and it was of the
utmost importance for him to win Bavaria to his side for the
furtherance of his plans for the future.</p>
<p class="par">No sooner was peace concluded than he confided to the
Bavarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, that Napoleon III., who in 1866
had wished to play the part of self-appointed arbitrator, had demanded
payment for this in the shape of a portion of Bavarian land. The
Minister told this on confidence to Ludwig, with the result that the
King made up his mind to enter into a treaty of defence with Prussia. A
few days afterwards he sent King Wilhelm an autograph communication, in
which, while referring to other topics, he observed that &ldquo;a firm
and lasting friendship was established between their houses and
states.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This alliance between two countries which had so
recently carried arms against one another, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>was
not at first made known to the public. Soon, however, reports began to
circulate that Ludwig was about to make a change of front in his
foreign policy. That these rumours influenced public opinion, he was
destined to receive unmistakable evidence. In the autumn of 1866 he
opened the Bavarian Chambers. From the Palace to the Landtag he drove
in a sumptuous coach drawn by six thoroughbred horses, a stately
cavalry guard in brilliant uniforms escorting him. The young ruler had
hitherto been used to storms of ovations when he showed himself to the
sight-loving and loyal inhabitants of Munich. The police had orders not
to prevent the shouting crowds from pressing forward. On this occasion
the order was unnecessary. The attitude of the populace was different
from its usual one; no shouts of hurrah were to be heard; no hand was
raised to doff the cap. His Majesty drove through the streets amid
oppressive silence. The whole occurrence was a party demonstration,
called forth by the violent agitation of the Clerical party, which was
endeavouring to play on the national strings. The behaviour of the
populace deeply affronted the King. He was so much annoyed at the cool
attitude of the capital, that he swore that after this day he would not
show himself in the streets of Munich oftener than was absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p class="par">The demonstration defeated its own end; it did
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>not succeed in inducing him to swerve from the
course he had entered upon in his foreign policy. Shortly afterwards
his friendly relations with Prussia became an acknowledged fact.</p>
<p class="par">On the last day of the year 1866 he formed a new
Ministry. The soul of this was the celebrated statesman, Prince
Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsf&uuml;rst, who in his younger days
had been in the Prussian service, and who already in 1849 had raised
his voice for a German confederation under the leadership of Prussia.
By family tradition, by education, and political sympathies he was an
out-and-out adherent of the policy of that country; and he was an
enthusiastic admirer of Bismarck. With the exception of Ludwig himself,
nearly the whole of the royal house strongly opposed the Premier and
his views. At the head of the court opposition was the old ex-King,
Ludwig I. To this party were united, moreover, almost the whole of the
nobility, and a preponderating majority of the Catholic clergy. The
nobility mistrusted Hohenlohe not only for his Bismarckian foreign
policy, but also, and this perhaps chiefly and primarily, on account of
his liberal views. The Catholic clergy hated him because he showed the
will and the ability to maintain the ascendancy of the state in
ecclesiastical questions, and combated the arrogant claims of the
Catholic prelates. Among a large majority of the population in general
he was also unpopular. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>The working classes looked upon
him as the &ldquo;Prussian&rdquo; and hatred of Prussia was during
those years extended and intense within the Bavarian people.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1630src" href="#xd21e1630" name=
"xd21e1630src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">In August, 1867, Hohenlohe announced formally in the
Landtag that an alliance of war had been concluded with Prussia. The
declaration aroused violent embitterment. One of the deputies, Dr
Ruland, fulminated against the &ldquo;links of slavery&rdquo; with
which the Prince desired to forge Bavaria fast to the aforesaid
country. When another speaker mentioned the &ldquo;brotherly
hand&rdquo; held out by Prussia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>Ruland pulled out a shell,
which he had picked up from the field of battle in 1866, and had kept:
&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;here is the brotherly hand
which Prussia holds out to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Great as was the irritation he had excited, Hohenlohe
went calmly on with his preparations to enable Bavaria to take part in
the Bismarckian scheme for the future. In the foremost rank of these
was the reorganisation of the Bavarian army, which had shown itself
during the war of 1866 to be on a very inefficient footing. One of his
first and most important works of legislation was also a new modern
system of conscription, after the Prussian model. Immediately after
this he placed before the Chamber a Bill by which it was intended to
make the schools independent of the Church. As Prime Minister of the
largest Catholic state in Germany he, moreover, regarded it as his duty
to step forward when Pius IX. announced his intention of declaring the
Infallibility of the Pope<span class="corr" id="xd21e1659" title=
"Not in source">.</span></p>
<p class="par">By this attitude he irritated the Clerical-Conservative
party to the uttermost. In the year 1868 violent dissensions took place
between the Particularists and the Ultramontanes, on the one side, and
the National Liberals on the other. The hatred towards Prussia and the
new school laws drove Particularists, Democrats, and Ultramontanes to
conclude a league which placed immense difficulties in the way of the
Ministry. The assault of the opposition did <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>not,
however, shake the King&rsquo;s confidence in his adviser, and in his
relations with Prussia, as well as in the ecclesiastical conflict, he
placed himself unreservedly on the side of Prince Hohenlohe.</p>
<p class="par">At the elections of 1869 the Ultramontanes succeeded in
gaining a decided majority; and according to parliamentary procedure
the Ministry resigned. Ludwig, however, would not accept the
resignation, and a violent struggle took place between the Government
and the representatives of labour. The opposition majority resolved
upon a vote of censure against Hohenlohe, who was as much hated as he
was feared. It was the earnest wish of the King that this might be
thrown out in the chamber of &ldquo;Reichsr&auml;the.&rdquo; Through
his Minister of Ceremonies he requested the Princes of the royal house
to refrain from voting against the Ministry, and he himself worked upon
his young brother with the same view. The Princes were present in full
force at the meeting. The King&rsquo;s cousin, Duke Carl Theodor,
entered the lists on behalf of Hohenlohe. But the others&mdash;even
Otto&mdash;voted with the majority.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig was incensed. He was particularly embittered by
his brother&rsquo;s vote. He knew that his uncles had influenced the
Prince; as the head of the family, and in virtue of his royal
authority, he forbade him the <i lang="fr">entr&eacute;e</i> for some
months to the court. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A deputation requested an audience for the purpose of
handing him the aforesaid address of censure, but admittance was not
granted to the presence. The Master of the Ceremonies received the
Deputies, and informed them that they must be pleased to let the
address reach his Majesty through the hands of his Ministers. The
reason for this unparliamentary attitude on Ludwig&rsquo;s side is said
to have arisen from the discovery of a correspondence between two
personages high in authority, which advocated no less than the
dethronement of the Monarch should he persevere in the agreement with
Prussia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1677src" href="#xd21e1677" name=
"xd21e1677src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">For the time being Hohenlohe remained at the helm of
office. But the fermentation continued, and the embitterment against
the Government increased.</p>
<p class="par">The fateful year of 1870 was entered upon. On the 19th
of January Hohenlohe declared in the Chamber that a state of the second
rank, like Bavaria, could only exist as allied to another kingdom, and
that that kingdom could only be Prussia, under whose leadership the
people of Bavaria must be prepared to fight in the event of war. His
open declaration called forth a storm. The <i lang="de">Vaterland</i>
newspaper wrote: &ldquo;Down with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>Hohenlohe, who is pushing
himself between the King and the people!... An evil spirit is making
its insidious way through Bavaria.&rdquo; The same journal assured the
French that the fall of the Ministry would be synonymous with the
neutrality of Bavaria. It continued in a threatening tone: &ldquo;Is
the country again to be subjected to the storms of an election on
account of a single Hohenlohe? The Prussians are perhaps counted upon.
It is hoped that riots will break out, which will offer the former a
welcome opportunity of penetrating into the country as rescuers.
Traitors! The enemies of Bavaria and its people! As soon as a Prussian
sets foot across the frontier of our country, six hundred thousand
French and four hundred thousand Austrians will put themselves in
motion to eject him. Bavaria shall belong to the Bavarians!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the Austrian press, and in the newspapers which were
under the influence of the Bavarian Jesuits, it was repeatedly said
that the King was incapable of governing; he was covered with <i lang=
"fr">l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i>. &ldquo;Ludwig II. by his conduct
has brought the country into a state of the utmost disquiet! If he will
not turn and listen to wiser counsels he will hazard his crown,&rdquo;
wrote the <i lang="la">Unica cattolica</i>. At the beginning of
February, 1870, Hohenlohe himself announced that it was his wish to
retire. Although the young Monarch still desired to retain him, the
Minister found it impossible, after due consideration, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>to
alter the decision he had taken. With great reluctance Ludwig then
accepted his resignation. He did it in a manner which showed the utmost
appreciation of the Prince; and the marks of distinction which he
conferred upon the latter bore witness to his gratitude and confidence.

following may be mentioned as a characteristic example of this
feeling:&mdash;The north German poet, Emanuel Geibel, was summoned by
Maximilian I. to the Bavarian court. He had been appointed to the chair
of literature, history, and poetry at the University of Munich, and the
King had granted him a yearly pension. At the time here mentioned he
was staying in his native town of Lubeck. King Wilhelm of Prussia came
on a visit to the town, and Geibel welcomed him with the following
verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="q">
<div class="nestedtext">
<div class="nestedbody">
<div lang="de" class="lgouter footnote">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Und sei&rsquo;s als letzter Wunsch

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par footnote">This lyrical outburst gave great offence to the
&ldquo;national&rdquo; party in Bavaria, and was construed as
expressing the poet&rsquo;s own opinion that Prussia ought to subjugate
the former country, which, of course, was not his meaning.</p>
<p class="par footnote">So strong was the feeling on this matter, that
Ludwig felt himself constrained to withdraw the pension which his
father had granted Geibel. But this withdrawal aroused displeasure in
North Germany, and the King of Prussia granted him a similar pension in
compensation.</p>
<p class="par footnote">In annoyance at the insult offered his
colleague and friend, Paul Heyse voluntarily gave up the pension which

<h2 class="main">A Meeting between Bismarck and Ludwig</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Bismarck, after the peace of 1866, had received a
visible sign of the Bavarian King&rsquo;s favour. Ludwig II. had
conferred upon him the Order of Humbertus, a distinction which,
according to the rules of the Order, is only to be given to men of
royal blood or to those who have in some particular manner served the
Bavarian state or throne.</p>
<p class="par">He wished greatly to meet the young Monarch. Bavaria
was, if not a great state, still great enough to weigh very
considerably in the scale in the adjustment between North Germany and
France which the Prussian statesman foresaw in the near future. It was,
however, not an ordinary official conference, with ceremonies and in
the presence of witnesses, which he desired, but a confidential
<i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</i>. He wrote to his old friend Prince
Hohenlohe. The latter, in his turn, addressed himself to Count
Holnstein, who was in close relations with the King, and who had been
the latter&rsquo;s playmate in childhood. He was now Ludwig&rsquo;s
trusted deputy, with the title of Chief Royal Master of the
Horse.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1715src" href="#xd21e1715" name=
"xd21e1715src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"
name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Although not a man of prominent parts, Count Holnstein
made himself almost invaluable as a court diplomat. It was arranged
that a meeting between the King and Bismarck should take place at the
Count&rsquo;s house. Both parties desired that it should be private,
and, as it were, accidental. The Prussian Minister came to Munich. He
was invited to drink tea at Count Holstein&rsquo;s; and he arrived
punctually. Immediately afterwards Ludwig came to call upon his Chief
Master of the Horse, and proved to be greatly interested in the meeting
with Bismarck. It was not long before the host took an opportunity to
disappear. Ludwig and the &ldquo;Iron Chancellor&rdquo; were alone.</p>
<p class="par">Verily, two contrasts! The one a man of will and action,
who in the course of a few years had set Middle Europe in fire and
flames&mdash;a warrior as well as a statesman, ruthless, cold-blooded,
undaunted at the table of council as well as in the turmoil of battle,
and at the time here mentioned in the full strength of his manhood. The
other&mdash;King Ludwig&mdash;still so young in years, vacillating and
shy, a hater of war, a dreamer, who enjoyed life most in the solitude
of nature and in the world of fancy. One might be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>tempted to say that realism and romance had here
set themselves a trysting place!</p>
<p class="par">Great as was the dissimilarity between these two men, a
common tie bound them together: the thought of the future of Germany
and the desire for the greatness of Germany filled the minds of
both.</p>
<p class="par">The world cracked its brains in vain to discover what
was talked of and agreed upon that evening at Count Holnstein&rsquo;s
house. No person was present; and nothing has ever been known with
certainty as to the details of the conversation. It may be assumed with
confidence, however, that the relations with France and the foreign
policy formed its chief topic. The great statesman and diplomat, who
knew how to be eloquent when it suited his projects, no doubt unfolded
his plans in vivid colours and fired the imagination of the romantic
<i>Schw&auml;rmer</i>. The meeting, which lasted long, seems to have
satisfied both. On both, no doubt, it left lasting impressions, and it
can hardly have been without significance in the development of the
history of the world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Outbreak of the War with France</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When Ludwig on the 17th January, 1870, opened the
Landtag, he said, in his Speech from the Throne: &ldquo;The agreement I
have concluded with Prussia is known to the country! Faithfully, in
conformity with this alliance, for which I have pledged my royal word,
I will, when my duty bids me do so, together with my powerful ally,
answer for the honour of Germany and therewith also for the honour of
Bavaria!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As mentioned in a previous chapter Hohenlohe had retired
at the beginning of 1870. This did not, however, betoken any change of
system, but was merely a personal change. Count von Bray, formerly the
Bavarian Minister at Vienna, who succeeded him as Minister of Foreign
Affairs, stood in all respects on the same political footing as his
predecessor, and the attacks of the Ultramontanes on the Government
were continued.</p>
<p class="par">Apart from party dissensions the first half-year,
however, passed quite quietly. There were probably but few in Bavaria
who suspected that a war was near at hand. Ludwig himself seems after
Hohenlohe&rsquo;s resignation to have been comparatively <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>unconcerned at the political fermentation in his
kingdom. He read and rode, made excursions to his hunting-boxes, did
the work his Ministers expected of him, and lived his usual quiet life.
Accompanied by his Master of the Horse, Hornig, he set off for the
highlands on the 18th of July. It was his intention to be away five or
six days; his private secretary had received orders only to send for
him in case of the extremest necessity. Suddenly came the news that
France had declared war on Prussia. As the Monarch&rsquo;s return was
delayed longer than had been expected, a messenger on horseback was
sent after him with the most important documents. On the 15th of July
he returned to Berg, the same evening at eleven he sent for his
secretary, Eisenhart. He received him in his balcony room on the first
floor, where he paced up and down the floor, as his habit was, sitting
down occasionally for a moment. Hours passed by, while they considered
the position together. The King, then hardly five-and-twenty years of
age, was still in full possession of his acute receptive powers, which
in certain respects he retained to the end. But he was no lover of war.
Repeatedly he said: &ldquo;Is there then no means, no possibility of
avoiding war?&rdquo; He finally recognised that it was inevitable. The
question became now: Whether Bavaria could remain neutral, or whether
his kingdom&mdash;in conformity with the treaty of 1866&mdash;should
fight by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>side of Prussia. The secretary observed that
neutrality would threaten the independence of Bavaria. To take a
position by the side of France against Prussia would be undignified.
He, moreover, regarded the agreement of 1866 as pledging Bavaria to
fight with Prussia and for Prussia. The Monarch was also of this
opinion. &ldquo;Before I make a decision I will wait for
Berchem&rsquo;s arrival. Let me be awakened as soon as he comes!&rdquo;
It was half-past three in the morning before the cabinet secretary left
the ch&acirc;teau. Day was breaking. An hour and a half later, Count
von Berchem arrived from the capital. The two men had a consultation
together on the position of affairs, and the secretary again returned
to the King, who received him in his bed-chamber. He was lying in his
blue four-post bed. The secretary read out loud a letter from Minister
Bray, which Count Berchem had brought with him. Once more they touched
upon the chief points in the great question. &ldquo;Prompt help is
double help, your Majesty,&rdquo; said Eisenhart. There was a pause.
Then the King said: &ldquo;<i lang="la">Bis dat, qui cito
dat!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Draft my command for the mobilisation of
the army. Invite the Ministers Bray and Pranckh to come to me this
afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock, and inform the press.&rdquo; The
secretary immediately prepared the required document. He handed it to
the King, who provided it with his signature.</p>
<p class="par">The political attitude of Bavaria was sealed.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>Ludwig&rsquo;s action on this day had a
significance which extended far beyond the military dispositions he had
made. The result of the war would probably have been the same without
Bavaria&rsquo;s assistance. But the future of Germany was decided by
the stroke of the King of Bavaria&rsquo;s pen on the morning of the
16th of July, for the alliance between Prussia and the greatest of the
South-German states had as its consequence the federation of Germany
and the German Empire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have never seen the King so satisfied as
to-day,&rdquo; declared his Minister Pranckh after the audience the
same afternoon. And when the equerry in attendance, von Sauer,
congratulated his Majesty, the latter said: &ldquo;Yes, I have the
feeling that I have done something good.&rdquo; A warm telegram of
thanks was sent to the Monarch by King Wilhelm in Berlin, and from
hundreds of others came enthusiastic telegrams.</p>
<p class="par">The following day, a Sunday, Ludwig travelled by special
train to Munich. There was immense movement in the streets; the
enthusiasm grew from minute to minute. The crowds felt the need of
thanking and congratulating their King. &ldquo;<i lang="de">Heil unserm
K&ouml;nig, heil!</i>&rdquo; was sung in chorus outside the Palace. The
enthusiasm rose indescribably when he showed himself at the window.
Everyone pressed forward to see him, and give expression to their
rejoicings. &ldquo;<i lang="de">Hoch, Ludwig! Hoch!</i>&rdquo; rose
like a single cry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"
name="pb115">115</a>]</span>from the Bavarian hearts. The homage of the
people made a deep impression on Ludwig. &ldquo;Shall I go to the
window once again?&rdquo; he asked, after showing himself many times,
as the shouts outside became louder and warmer. He was received with
ovations in the evening, when he appeared at the performance of
Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Die Walk&uuml;re</i>. The shouts of hurrah for the
King continued to ring. Day after day, till far into the night, the
crowds surged backwards and forwards. One cannot know how the dice may
fall,&rdquo; said the Bavarian Minister of War. &ldquo;But this I can
already say for certain: the army will come out of the battle with
honour!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Inner strife was smoothed away for a time under the
feeling of fellowship which had seized upon all parties. Those in chief
command, however, did not dare give themselves up to too great
illusions. It was not, indeed, on account of the military ability of
the Bavarians, but on account of the moral support coming from that
land, that the Prussian leaders, with Bismarck at their head, so highly
praised King Ludwig&rsquo;s action. The commanders of the South-German
army, whom the Prussians derisively called <i lang="fr">les flaneurs
batailles</i>, had shown themselves to be incapable in the war of 1866.
Only the mere semblance of a command was given them in 1870, all real
authority was being invested in the hands of the Prussian generals.</p>
<p class="par">The Crown Prince of Prussia received orders <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>to
take chief command of the South-German army. That Friedrich was not
without anxiety is apparent from the following expression in his diary:
&ldquo;It is a difficult task for me to fight the French with troops
who do not like us Prussians, and who are not educated in our
school.&rdquo; On his way to the army he paid visits to the allied
Princes whose troops he was to lead, going first to Munich and thence
to Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. At all the stations where the train stopped
preparations to welcome him had been made. Ludwig II. went part of the
way to receive him, and the two Princes met each other with cordiality.
Together with the King and Prince Otto, he drove in an open carriage
through the streets of the capital of Bavaria. Waving handkerchiefs and
shouts of hurrah followed in their train. In the evening the King and
his guest were present at the Hof Theater, where Schiller&rsquo;s
<i>Wallensteins Lager</i> was given. Shouts of delight filled the house
when the Crown Prince showed himself by Ludwig&rsquo;s side. The
Queen-mother, too, who but very rarely visited the theatre, was also
present. The curtain was raised. The actor Possart repeated a
prologue:</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Denn was im Drange der Gefahr auf&rsquo;s

<p class="par">At the words &ldquo;<i lang="de">Treue um
Treue</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i lang="de">Heil! dreifach
Heil!</i>&rdquo; there was a movement which spread all through the
theatre. All were deeply affected.</p>
<p class="par">The King of Bavaria stepped forward with his guest. They
shook hands with one another, and formally sealed their compact in the
eye of the people. At this indescribable moment the warmth of popular
feeling rose to a storm of rejoicing.</p>
<p class="par">Seized by the solemnity of the moment, the two Princes
stood hand in hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">During the War&mdash;The German Empire is
Proclaimed</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The blue and white Bavarian and the black and
white Prussian banners were waving side by side in the streets when the
Crown Prince proceeded on his journey that same evening. The King
accompanied him to the railway station; Prince Otto and Prince Luitpold
followed him to war.</p>
<p class="par">Never before had Ludwig felt himself more beloved by his
people, never before had he been regarded with greater respect by the
whole of Germany. But the demands which were made at this time on his
powers of work, the representative duties which he had not been able to
avoid, had over-taxed his strength. His physical sufferings took
possession of him to so great a degree that he found it not only
impossible to proceed to the seat of war, but also to remain in his
capital. The great victories which succeeded one another aroused a
feeling of the utmost joy among his people. But he who was not on the
field of battle, felt the good tidings as almost a reproach. He was not
master of his moods; the public which satisfied him one day displeased
and wearied him the next. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of September he came from Berg to Munich. The
day afterwards he called upon a Russian Grand Duchess who was passing
through his capital. It was the day of Sedan. The news that the French
army had surrendered and that Napoleon was a prisoner reached him the
following morning. Everywhere the victory was celebrated, for it was
thought to be the precursor of a conclusion of peace. In the towns and
villages of Bavaria there were illuminations, flags and banners, music
and showers of flowers. Only the ruler of the country did not
participate in the general rejoicings. Despite the earnest
representations of the Minister of the Royal House and of his equerry,
he could not be persuaded to remain in Munich on the 3rd of September.
He said to his Minister, &ldquo;As there is neither a German Empire nor
a German Republic, as hitherto there has not been any German
Confederation, it is my wish that only Bavarian flags, or better still,
no flags at all, shall be hoisted on the Government
buildings.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1833src" href="#xd21e1833"
name="xd21e1833src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">He returned to his solitude. The procession which the
same evening defiled past the Royal Palace greeted the Queen-mother,
who was standing at the window, with lively shouts of hurrah. But it
pained all parties that the Monarch disdained their homage on this day.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>No sooner had the Crown Prince of Prussia left
Munich than he received a letter from Ludwig in which the latter
expressed the wish that &ldquo;the independence of Bavaria might be
respected at the conclusion of peace.&rdquo; The handwriting was bad,
and the lines uneven; but the contents bore witness to the warmth of
his patriotism. Friedrich ridiculed this &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo;
letter. Amiable as the King had been towards the Crown Prince of
Prussia during his short visit, the impression received by the guest
had not been altogether favourable. In April 1868 he had visited him
when on a journey to Italy, and had enjoyed being in his company. Now
he was &ldquo;alarmed at the alteration two years had made.&rdquo; He
noted in his diary that Ludwig gave the impression of being very
nervous, that he was less handsome than formerly, and had lost one of
his front teeth.</p>
<p class="par">The young King knew that comparisons had been made
between him and the King of Prussia, who led his army in person. He
could not possibly be blind to the fact that this comparison was not to
his advantage, hiding himself away as he did, and shunning the love of
his people. Good and bad feelings were fighting for the mastery in his
soul. He was a faithful and honourable ally. After the victory at Metz
he congratulated the King of Prussia as &ldquo;William the
Conqueror,&rdquo; and he sent the Crown Prince the Order of Max Joseph.
But he gave his Ministers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>contradictory orders where the
negotiations with Prussia were concerned. Although his mother was a
Hohenzollern, his personal sympathies were by no means wedded to this
house.</p>
<p class="par">The thought of a German Empire had arisen. At the
headquarters at Versailles the project was discussed, and it was
thought that King Wilhelm should be the Emperor. This was the object of
both Bismarck&rsquo;s and the Crown Prince&rsquo;s labours. With regard
to details, however, their views were at complete variance. Friedrich
desired a German unified state; he thought of the Emperor as surrounded
by responsible ministers. The German Princes would, of course, govern
within the limits of their countries, but their power must be
considerably curtailed; and those who would not voluntarily make
sacrifices for the federated fatherland must be made to do so by force.
The Chancellor, on the other hand, was of opinion that the Princes
ought to be protected as far as was possible, and that they ought to
retain their rights. He greatly desired that the Empire might arise
from a free agreement on their side. &ldquo;If only the South Germans
would take the decisive step!&rdquo; he often said.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1849src" href="#xd21e1849" name="xd21e1849src">2</a> The King
of Prussia had up to the last moment little desire to accept the
Imperial crown. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span>Should it, however, prove to be necessary,
he wished that it might take place on the invitation of the King of
Bavaria. Ludwig was pressingly invited to come to Versailles. Shortly
before this he had, through a fall from his horse, twisted his ankle,
with the result that it caused him excessive pain to sit on horseback.
Still, for a short time, he considered the question of proceeding
thither. Bismarck&rsquo;s secretary, Busch, tells us in his memoirs
that it was thought to summon a congress of Princes on the 11th of
October, and that it was hoped that the King of Bavaria would be
present. The historical rooms of Versailles were to be placed at his
disposal, as it was considered that he would appreciate this mark of
attention. &ldquo;I never thought that I should come to play the part
of a major-domo at Trianon,&rdquo; said Bismarck. &ldquo;If only the
King will come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the King did not come.</p>
<p class="par">On the 19th of October the Ministers of W&uuml;rtemberg,
Hesse, and Baden went to Versailles. On the 20th the King of Bavaria
sent his Ministers Bray, Pranckh, and Lutz to the headquarters.</p>
<p class="par">It appeared at first as if the negotiations would be
crowned with success; the desire that South Germany should offer King
Wilhelm the Imperial crown seemed to be nearing its fulfilment. The
leaders of the national party developed a restless energy. Large
meetings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>of the people accepted resolutions which made
for the same end. The press warmly advocated a German Empire. The
greatest enthusiasm in favour of the project was shown in Prussia and
in Baden; but it spread from land to land.</p>
<p class="par">On the 7th of November negotiations took place between
the Ministers of W&uuml;rtemberg, Hesse, and Baden. The Bavarian
Minister was not invited to take part in it, no agreement having been
come to with Bavaria. This annoyed Ludwig. &ldquo;Why do they conclude
agreements with W&uuml;rtemberg, Baden, and Hesse and not till later
with my Government?&rdquo; he exclaimed in anger. He was tired of the
throne, tired of European politics. His nerves were overstrung, and he
demanded that Prince Otto should at once leave the seat of war; he
awaited his arrival at Hohenschwangau with impatience. &ldquo;I look
upon my brother as the King,&rdquo; he said to those about him.
&ldquo;Matters hang on a single thin thread, and then it will be,
&lsquo;<i lang="fr">Le roi Louis II. est mort. Vive le roi Othon
I.!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On the 5th of November the Prince arrived; not without
danger had he travelled day and night to fulfil his brother&rsquo;s
wish. The King talked much and excitedly to him of abdicating the
throne. Otto dissuaded him from such a step in the most affectionate
manner. He asked permission to return to Versailles; but it was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>not until peace was all but concluded that he
obtained the Monarch&rsquo;s consent to this step. Ludwig soon changed
his mind with regard to his abdication. &ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; he said
shortly afterwards to a gentleman of his <i>entourage</i>, &ldquo;Count
B. really believes that I am seriously thinking of abdicating.&rdquo;
He enforced the necessity on several influential personages, &ldquo;of
using every effort in order that these rumours should be definitely put
a stop to.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1886src" href="#xd21e1886"
name="xd21e1886src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">By the 15th of November an agreement had been come to
with Baden and Hesse. Accord with W&uuml;rtemberg seemed likewise near
at hand. But suddenly steps were taken from Munich which caused the
Government in Stuttgart to assume a waiting position; the
W&uuml;rtembergian delegates received a telegraphic message to the
effect &ldquo;that they were to go hand in hand with their Bavarian
colleagues.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1894src" href=
"#xd21e1894" name="xd21e1894src">4</a> It became known that this later
change of front was owing to the intrigues of the Austrian Chancellor,
Count von Beust, who was at this time a visitor at Munich, and who had
always been the enemy of Prussia.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig made strenuous attempts to preserve the
independence of his country, demanding during the negotiations not only
independent sovereignty with regard to home affairs, but also that
Bavaria should continue to have an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>independent army and her own
foreign policy. As he would not give way an inch in the matter, the
question of the German Empire stood for some time on an exceedingly
critical footing.</p>
<p class="par">The Crown Prince of Prussia was filled with indignation
over the protracted nature of the proceedings, and wished to break down
the opposition of Bavaria by force. The wise Bismarck, however, advised
a considerate course. &ldquo;With the Bavarian troops fighting with the
Prussians against France, Prussia can hardly coerce their
country.&rdquo; The Grand Duke of Baden had come to the headquarters;
he sent one of his confidential friends to Munich to persuade Ludwig to
proceed to Versailles. The Bavarian Ministers likewise exerted
themselves to induce him to make the journey. &ldquo;I know well that
in many respects it would be advisable for me to make this
journey,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;It need hardly be said that it
would also be of political advantage. But I feel myself too suffering.
Whether or not I take the journey depends, moreover, on the guarantees
which I desire. Without them I will not go! Here the matter
rests&mdash;it is my will!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ludwig is not coming to Versailles, firstly,
because he cannot ride just now without discomfort, and, secondly,
because he does not like playing second fiddle,&rdquo; wrote
Bismarck&rsquo;s secretary, Busch, in his journal.</p>
<p class="par">No one could deny that he had done Prussia <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>invaluable service by the rapidity with which he
had decided to mobilise his army. He now thought his action entitled
him to ask a service in return from this country. One of his wishes was
to extend the frontiers of his land. His Ministers inquired whether the
Palatinate of Baden, which in olden days had been the territory of the
Electors of Bavaria, could be ceded to Bavaria, Baden receiving as
indemnity a portion of Alsace-Lorraine. To this Bismarck answered
decisively that &ldquo;Baden was a &lsquo;<i lang="la">noli me
tangere</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; and that neither King Wilhelm nor the
Archduke of Baden would ever agree to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On the evening of the 23rd of November he had another
meeting with the Bavarian Ministers. An agreement was at last come to.
After they had left him, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening, he said
in a satisfied tone: &ldquo;German unity is a completed act, and the
&lsquo;Emperor&rsquo; likewise. It is an event!... The agreement has
its weak points; but as it is, it is more tenable. I consider it to be
the most important thing we have accomplished this year. With regard to
the &lsquo;Emperor&rsquo; I made him more acceptable during the
negotiations, as I represented to the Ministers that it must be easier
and more convenient for their Kings to allow the German Emperor certain
privileges than to allow them to the neighbouring King of
Prussia.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig made a last attempt to maintain his position.
Prince Adalbert pressed him to put <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>forward a claim that the
Kings of Bavaria and of Prussia should alternately wear the Imperial
crown; and Prince Luitpold was pushed forward to make this proposal.
Bismarck scouted the idea, remarking: &ldquo;The King of Bavaria lives
in a world of dreams. He is hardly more than a boy who does not know
his own mind!&rdquo; The Prussian statesman, it need hardly be said,
was careful not to say this directly to Ludwig. He wrote a long and
exceedingly deferential letter to him, in which he emphasised how
necessary it was that the Imperial crown should be <i>offered</i> to
the King of Prussia, and that it was for the King of Bavaria to take
the first step. If the last-named would not make the proposal, the
Princes of the smaller states would do this, and Ludwig in such a case
could not avoid following in their footsteps.</p>
<p class="par">The descendant of the thousand-year-old House of
Wittelsbach, which had counted three emperors among its forefathers,
bent before the force of circumstances. He telegraphed to his Minister,
Count Bray, that the latter was to inform Bismarck that Count Holnstein
would arrive at Versailles within three days, to discuss with him the
details of the matter. &ldquo;Not till then&rdquo;&mdash;he expressed
himself&mdash;&ldquo;shall I be able to make a final decision.&rdquo;
Holnstein hurried off. Without losing a moment&rsquo;s time he sought
out Bismarck, and made him acquainted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>with his errand,
after which he immediately returned to Hohenschwangau.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig was in bed with a toothache, and would not be
disturbed, but the Count knew how to arouse his curiosity in such a
manner that he was received in audience all the same. He brought with
him two sealed envelopes; the one contained a renewed demand to Ludwig
to offer Wilhelm the Imperial crown; the other was the draft, composed
by Bismarck, of a communication from the King of Bavaria in which this
was done. The application was favourably received. Ludwig at once
decided to follow the Prussian statesman&rsquo;s instructions. With his
own hand he wrote the letter which transformed Germany into an empire.
Count Holnstein now rode to Munich, in conformity with the King&rsquo;s
command that he should confer with Secretary Eisenhart, whom he found
in the Residenz Theater. He presented the aforesaid letter from Ludwig
to the King of Prussia, also one to Eisenhart in which his master
inquired whether he considered it desirable that another communication,
couched in terms more suited to the circumstances, should be sent: in
such a case the King gave Eisenhart a free hand to retain his own
letter. The secretary sent it on without alteration. Holnstein swung
himself up on his horse again and rode off to Versailles. In accordance
with Ludwig&rsquo;s express command, his communication <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>was
handed to the King of Prussia by Prince Luitpold.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The King of Bavaria has copied Bismarck&rsquo;s
letter word for word,&rdquo; noted Prince Friedrich in his journal.</p>
<p class="par">The delight was great all over Germany. It was known
that it was the young King of Bavaria, who had spoken the word at the
right moment. Only the initiated were cognisant that he had done it
under pressure and after hesitation. Hardly a dinner was given, and no
political meeting was held, but the health of &ldquo;Ludwig the
German&rdquo; was drunk with enthusiasm. The greatest satisfaction
prevailed at headquarters. He was no longer now &ldquo;the boy who did
not know his own mind.&rdquo; Both Bismarck and the King of Prussia
expressed themselves in terms of the warmest recognition of the
Bavarian Sovereign.</p>
<p class="par">The proclamation of the Empire was to take place at
Versailles on the 18th of January, 1871. Three days before this date
the future emperor summoned the court chaplain to him. He spoke of
Ludwig II.&rsquo;s idealism, and added: &ldquo;Whatever his abilities
may be, he must at any rate be very highly considered.&rdquo; Bismarck
at an entertainment rose to his feet, and made the following
speech:&mdash;&ldquo;I drink to the health of his Majesty the King of
Bavaria, and to the prosperity of his dynasty, which has extended
through a thousand years! I can only repeat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>that
as long as I have a voice in matters, a step shall never be taken which
might wound Bavaria in its rightful position. His Majesty the King will
find in me, as long as I live, a servant as attached as if I were still
his vassal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1944src" href=
"#xd21e1944" name="xd21e1944src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">After the death of Ludwig II. the Chancellor of the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The war was ended; the peace concluded. A great
German Empire had been re-established. Germany had been given an
Emperor&mdash;and that Emperor was the King of Prussia.</p>
<p class="par">With the last-named fact the essence of the new Empire
is characterised: Prussia was the paramount country. The other four and
seventy states were not to be without a voice in the decision of the
common affairs of the realm, and each one was to retain a certain
independence, but Prussia was, and intended to be, the state to lead
the course of events&mdash;the centre of gravity which was to decide
the balance.</p>
<p class="par">Thanks to Ludwig II.&rsquo;s obstinacy, his kingdom had
formally received a special position. The new constitution granted
Bavaria in a special paragraph<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1964src"
href="#xd21e1964" name="xd21e1964src">1</a> the right to all the
attributes which are considered as belonging to national independence:
she retained, for instance, her own Minister of War, her own army, her
own Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the right to independent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>diplomatic and consular services. The appearance
of sovereignty was retained. But Ludwig&rsquo;s burning desire to
extend the frontiers of his kingdom had not been fulfilled. This
circumstance was the cause, on his side, of much displeasure towards
the Royal House of Prussia.</p>
<p class="par">The returning troops were to make their entry into
Munich on the 16th July, 1871. The city was filled to overflowing. A
number of travellers passing through the capital were obliged to pass
the night in the open air or in their carriages. Day had hardly broken
before people were seen hurrying forth to secure places for themselves.
All were awaiting with excitement the moment which should bring back
the relations and friends who had been so sorely missed during the now
concluded war. Gymnasts and members of fire brigades, who were to keep
the streets open, marched up playing their bands. Shortly afterwards
the students arrived with their picturesque scarves across their
shoulders, the artists with green branches in their hats, rifle
associations and societies with their banners and flags, their duty
being to line the streets for the returning troops, and add to the
general rejoicing by their singing. The sun sent forth its rays over
the capital, the streets became more and more animated. The bells were
rung from all the churches, salutes boomed forth. According to the
programme, the King was to hold a review <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>at nine
o&rsquo;clock, but the stands for the spectators were more than filled
long before that time. Then a festive stillness fell over the assembled
people. Mothers and fathers held up their little children in their arms
so that they might witness the scene. Majestically handsome, Ludwig II.
rode at a sharp trot from the &ldquo;triumphal arch&rdquo; to the
statue of Ludwig I., where the troops were to defile past him. A
brilliant suite accompanied him. The hurrahs from thousands of throats
filled the air. On the royal stand the female members of the royal
house were seated. Far away, down at the triumphal arch, the
Uhlans&rsquo;&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;light horse&rdquo;&mdash;blue
and white banners were visible. They came nearer and nearer. The
Inspector-General of the Army, Prince Luitpold, rode between his
aides-de-camp and officers, nodding pleasantly to the cheering crowds.
The Crown Prince of the German Empire, who now rode past, was received
with audible expressions of welcome. The chief burgomaster of the city
made a speech, which the former amiably answered, and three young girls
offered the conqueror of W&ouml;rth a wreath of laurels. A deep
stillness reigned during the speeches, but as soon as they were ended
the enthusiasm broke out afresh. The Crown Prince as he continued his
ride was pelted with flowers from all the windows. At the Odeon Platz
he rode up to the right side of King Ludwig; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>both
sat their horses while the soldiers defiled past. The Crown Prince was
the leader of the soldiery&mdash;he had shared danger and hardship with
them; Ludwig was their own beloved King; and they did homage to both
with equal heartiness. But Friedrich had gained laurels in the war, and
had become the heir to an Imperial crown. Ludwig was a sick man who
stood jealous and doubting before the homage which was being shown to
his cousin. The entrance of the troops lasted for four hours, and was
not ended until after one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p class="par">Later in the day a dinner was given at the Palace, where
the court displayed all its brilliancy. The King drank to the health of
the army and of its leader, who was crowned with honour, after which
the Crown Prince returned thanks to Ludwig in a lengthy speech. At
seven o&rsquo;clock the dinner came to an end. The court, and the
officers and civilians invited by the Minister of War, then adjourned
to a gala performance in the royal theatre, where <i>Der Friede</i> by
Paul Heyse was the piece given.</p>
<p class="par">The returning warriors, and the citizens of the
metropolis and their dames, made merry until far into the night and the
following day. The cheers for the King, for the Crown Prince of
Prussia, for all who had fought and conquered, were ceaseless.</p>
<p class="par">The military bands which had so long been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>absent were once more heard in the great
Feldherren Halle. Patriotic songs were played on the stands in the
Odeon Platz. The houses were illuminated. All were delighted at the
success of the reception, and at the friendship between the King and
the Crown Prince, which was looked upon as a good omen for the new
alliance.</p>
<p class="par">The day afterwards the royal family, with their guest,
made an excursion to the Roseninsel, where the roses were in full
bloom. Ludwig, wishing to do honour to Friedrich and give him pleasure,
asked his permission, as they were walking together in the afternoon,
to make him colonel of one of his regiments of light horse. The Crown
Prince answered loftily that it depended on the Emperor whether he
could accept the offer or not, adding, with a smile: &ldquo;I do not
know if the slim Uhlan uniform would suit my stout figure!&rdquo; The
King was greatly displeased with this remark, and later repeated it to
several persons.</p>
<p class="par">After the return from the Roseninsel he informed his
secretary that he would under no circumstances be present at the
military banquet in the Glas Palast the following day. This banquet, to
which nine hundred invitations had been issued, and which was to mark
the height of the festivities, was given in honour of Friedrich, but
was intended at the same time to be a recognition shown to the Bavarian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>army. The secretary wrote a letter to his
Majesty, in which, with the deepest respect, he endeavoured to persuade
him at least <span class="corr" id="xd21e1992" title=
"Source: tos how">to show</span> himself for some minutes, pointing out
that his absence might have extended political consequences. He
described in graphic words the pleasure the Monarch would give the
brave and faithful defenders of his country if he showed them the
honour of being their comrade at table. The King answered that he
needed quiet. This, however, did not preclude the hope that at the last
moment he might appear.</p>
<p class="par">The dinner, nevertheless, took place without him.
Shortly before nine the Crown Prince Friedrich arrived with his suite.
The house of Bavaria was represented by the greater number of its
princes; but a painful impression was caused by the King&rsquo;s
absence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1998src" href="#xd21e1998" name=
"xd21e1998src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">At four o&rsquo;clock the following morning the wife of
the private secretary was awakened by the tramp of horses in the
courtyard, which was otherwise so quiet. She ran to the window and saw
the royal equipage standing with the horses harnessed to it. Ludwig
entered, and it set off at a quick trot in the early morning hour for
the ch&acirc;teau of Berg.</p>
<p class="par">Four hours later a royal servant brought his
Majesty&rsquo;s orders that the secretary should proceed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>out
to Schloss Berg, and hold a lecture for him there.</p>
<p class="par">The Crown Prince of Prussia left the Bavarian capital
the same forenoon, after taking a hearty leave of the royal princes,
who were all present at the railway station to bid him farewell.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">A Visit from the Emperor Wilhelm&mdash;Ludwig
Withdraws more and more from the World</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ludwig II. and the Crown Prince of Germany had
been mutually displeased with one another. Nevertheless, Friedrich had
hardly left the Bavarian capital before information was received that
his father, the aged Emperor, desired to meet the King. The last-named,
doubtless, was, in his heart, not particularly delighted at the
prospective visit; but he put a good face on the matter, and received
his guest on Bavarian soil with all the courtesy and amiability that
could be desired.</p>
<p class="par">His people gave the Emperor a hearty greeting. The two
Monarchs drove together amid hearty cheers into Ratisbon, where a
banquet was held at the hotel &ldquo;Goldenes Kreuz.&rdquo; Contrary to
what had taken place during the Crown Prince&rsquo;s visit, the meeting
between the young King and the &ldquo;victorious old man&rdquo; passed
off in the most satisfactory manner, and not even the shade of any
unpleasantness was to be traced.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig returned to Berg the same evening. The Emperor
remained the night at the hotel, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139"
href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>and the next morning
continued his journey to Gastein, where he was going to take the
baths.</p>
<p class="par">On his return he again visited the royal family of
Bavaria. The visit was this time chiefly to his cousin, the
Queen-mother. She was residing at Hohenschwangau, and received him
there with both her sons. The weather was splendid. In the evening the
picturesquely situated castle was brilliantly illuminated; and the
intercourse between the royal kinsfolk was gay and hearty. Wilhelm
remained at the castle till the following day. Ludwig and the Emperor
talked confidentially together for a long time, and parted with mutual
assurances of friendship. The meeting between the Princes was commented
on by the whole of the European press. &ldquo;Now it is King
Ludwig&rsquo;s turn to pay a return visit to Berlin,&rdquo; said a
friend to Secretary Eisenhart. &ldquo;The King is not very fond of
official journeys,&rdquo; remarked Eisenhart. &ldquo;Nor is it
necessary,&rdquo; answered his friend; &ldquo;for, according to what I
heard in Berlin, the Emperor does not require any return visit. He
judges the King of Bavaria by quite a different standard from the other
German princes in view of the sacrifices he has made for Prussia. The
Crown Prince is said to be of another opinion; when he ascends the
throne he will certainly show this!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2025src" href="#xd21e2025" name="xd21e2025src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Emperor Wilhelm was one of the few princes who saw
and talked with Ludwig II. As a rule, the Bavarian King avoided the
visits of his compeers. A number of royal personages came to Munich
during his reign, and the greater number of them wished to pay him
their respects; but, as a rule, he excused himself from receiving the
august travellers on the plea of indisposition. The King and Queen of
Saxony, the Queen of W&uuml;rtemberg, the Emperor and Empress of
Brazil, and many other princes and princesses, never even saw a glimpse
of him. The Emperor of Austria visited his relatives in Bavaria almost
every year, but in spite of the friendly relations between Ludwig and
the Empress the King used not to show himself to her husband.</p>
<p class="par">It would certainly be wronging Ludwig to assume that his
indisposition was only an excuse to avoid the visitors. As a matter of
fact, he was tortured and sick both in body and mind. He suffered from
insomnia, and complained of constant and violent pains in the back of
his head. He began also to avoid his capital. The noise of the streets,
the curiosity of the people, the royal tombs, which he could see from
the windows of the Palace&mdash;all annoyed him! He hardly ever went on
foot when in Munich; and when he drove out in the English Garden sat
hidden from the glances of the multitude, leaning far back in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>a closed carriage. Nevertheless, he continued to
be popular. But even the people&rsquo;s homage sometimes displeased
him. He used to speak of himself as &ldquo;sacrificed to
ovations.&rdquo; Court balls and court festivities were a misery to
him; when he took part in them it was only as a duty. In order to avoid
seeing the guests at table whom he did not like, he ordered vases of
flowers to be placed before them. Sincerely as the people and the court
desired that he would remain in the capital, he could not, of course,
be prevented from ordering his life according to his own tastes, or
from spending the greater part of his time in the highlands. But though
he sought solitude, and more and more gave himself up to it, and though
at times he certainly required it on account of the weakness of his
nerves, he was, nevertheless, little fitted to live alone. Despite his
hermit tendencies he showed an ever-recurring need to talk with those
around him on all the things which occupied his thoughts. His lacqueys
and grooms were even required to tell him news of the neighbouring
country-folk. More than is usually the case with the generality of
people, he was dependent in his sympathies on an attractive manner, a
pleasant voice, and a pleasing exterior. His relations with Richard
Wagner show that he could be faithful in friendship, but, as a rule, he
was unaccountable in his feelings. Some persons he judged in cold
blood; in the case of others, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"
href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>he permitted his temperament
to carry him to extremes of great unfairness. From certain people he
would bear much; the slightest contradiction on the part of others
would be sufficient to incur his lasting disfavour.</p>
<p class="par">His love of solitude grew by degrees to be a disease,
and at times he literally fled from people. In the middle of the
seventies the Queen-mother gave a family party at the Swiss
ch&acirc;let &ldquo;Pleckenau,&rdquo; not far from Hohenschwangau. The
King, Prince Otto, their aides-de-camp, the Mistress of the Court, and
two ladies-in-waiting, were with her. The little party were sitting at
table in excellent spirits when a mounted messenger with a telegram
arrived from the castle: the Austrian Archduke Rainer, who was staying
at Bregenz, asked her Majesty whether it would be convenient for her to
receive him the following morning. She handed the telegram to the King,
who grew pale as he read it. The displeasure visible on his features
affected the whole party. He rose from the table and went out, the
others remaining seated. Without a word, he went back to
Hohenschwangau. Arrived there, he ordered two carriages to be got ready
and to await further orders. The preparations were to be made so
quietly that no one would have any suspicion of what was taking place.
A little while later the Queen-mother, his brother, and the courtiers
returned; and soon the building <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>was quite quiet. The
gentlemen of the court lived in a house beside the castle. The
King&rsquo;s apartments were on the first floor, his mother and her
ladies inhabiting the ground floor. Only by stealing softly down the
stairs could he reach the courtyard of the castle without being heard.
Ludwig and his servant accomplished this undetected, and hied them to
the royal stables, which are situated at some distance away. With all
the speed possible, and in the middle of the night, the King drove to a
little village which he was occasionally in the habit of visiting. Here
the announcement of his arrival was like a bolt from the blue. The
master of the posting station where he alighted had let all his rooms
to a military commission; these gentlemen had to be got out of the way
as quickly as possible. All had gone to bed, and had to be aroused. The
general had only time to half-dress himself and rush out before he met
his King on the staircase. At three in the morning Ludwig at last went
to bed; despite sedatives it was not possible for him to procure any
rest.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning the King received a telegram informing
him that the Archduke Rainer had left, &ldquo;after
half-an-hour&rsquo;s visit.&rdquo; Ludwig gave orders for his horses to
be put to at once. A breakfast which he had ordered, and paid for with
eighty guldens, was left untouched. He returned to Hohenschwangau with
the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>speed with which he had left it. His mother
greeted him from her window. Laughing, he called up to her; &ldquo;I
avoided that visit nicely, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; The Queen-mother,
although she was not satisfied with his flight, was obliged to laugh
too.</p>
<p class="par">It will easily be understood that his increasing shyness
was a subject of conversation in all circles. We have heard that
rumours had already been current that he thought of abdicating the
throne; these were fed by his strange caprices and his retired life.
Count Holnstein wrote to Bismarck as early as 1871: &ldquo;Before every
audience and every court ceremony the King drinks large quantities of
strong wine, and he then says the most extraordinary things. He wishes
to abdicate in favour of Prince Otto, who does not entertain the
slightest wish for it.... The Ultramontanes know this. They have chosen
their candidate for the National Assembly: Prince Luitpold; he is also
their candidate for the throne. Perhaps they will succeed in getting
him elected in spite of Prince Otto&rsquo;s claims!&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h2 class="main">Prince Otto&rsquo;s Insanity&mdash;The King&rsquo;s
Morbid Sensations</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The House of Wittelsbach has been terribly ravaged
by insanity. In the course of one hundred years more than twenty
members of the family have been visited by this misfortune.</p>
<p class="par">The sons of Maximilian II. were burdened with
exceedingly neurotic tendencies. Their grandfather had been eccentric
in a high degree; and a sister of King Maximilian was for long retained
in a madhouse. The parents of Ludwig II. and Prince Otto were,
moreover, near relations. They were both connected by ties of blood
with the Royal House of Hesse-Darmstadt, where there had been insanity
for many years. The grandmothers of the Bavarian Queen-mother, on both
her father&rsquo;s and her mother&rsquo;s side, were Hessian
princesses. The mother of Ludwig I., who died in her youth, likewise
belonged to this house; and his wife was the granddaughter of a
princess of Darmstadt.</p>
<p class="par">At the beginning of 1872 the newspapers began to insert
notices in their columns to the effect that Prince Otto of Bavaria was
suffering. In the fifties and sixties he had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>the
picture of health. Where Ludwig had withdrawn, he had gone forward
towards people with outstretched hands. He had always been gay,
amiable, and lively. The unnaturally strict upbringing, and the
rapidity with which, from almost unendurable restraint, he had been
thrown into unfettered freedom, had, however, been a concurrent cause
of his losing his mental balance. Hardly two and twenty years of age,
he had followed the army (1870). We know that, despite his wish to
remain with it, the King had recalled him to Hohenschwangau. The
summons was probably the dictate of the elder brother&rsquo;s personal
feelings; but the Prince&rsquo;s nervous system had also shown itself
to be unfitted for the bloody scenes of a battlefield. Crown Prince
Friedrich wrote in his diary: &ldquo;Prince Otto came to take leave
before his return to Munich. He was looking pale and wretched. He sat
in front of me, apparently suffering from cold shivering fits, while I
developed to him the necessity of our making common cause in military
and diplomatic affairs. I could not make out whether he understood me,
or only heard what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Shortly after his return he began to show the first
signs of insanity. The report of this aroused general sorrow. He had
been given the affectionate nickname of &ldquo;<span lang="de">Otto der
Fr&ouml;hliche</span>.&rdquo; In spite of predisposition, and in spite
of the circumstances attending his birth, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>which might furnish
some ground for the supposition that the germ of the malady was to be
sought there, the public would not at first credit the news. He was
seen daily in the streets, the theatre, and at the circus. Suddenly his
sickness took a violent turn. He had to be placed under restraint, and
some occurrences which took place caused the physicians to advise his
being sent away from Munich. The Prince, however, would not agree to
this. For the time being, therefore, he remained where he was, though
it was found impossible to allow him to be alone. At length he was
declared to be incurably mad, and was completely separated from his
relations. The King was very decided in his wish that he should not
live in the vicinity of the castles he himself was in the habit of
occupying. He was, therefore, taken to Nymphenburg, and two years later
to the lonely F&uuml;rstenreid. His mother was inconsolable at the
misfortune which had struck her favourite child; and Ludwig also
greatly felt the blow. When, on his accession, the ceremonies for his
father&rsquo;s funeral had been decided upon, and he had been asked
what place the Prince should take, he had answered without hesitation:
&ldquo;At my side!&rdquo; The younger brother&rsquo;s light-hearted
temperament had formed a favourable contrast to his serious, heavy view
of life. He had regarded him as his successor, and hoped that Otto by
making <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>a brilliant match would repair the injury done
to the country by his own celibacy. Instead of this, he had from mental
dulness sunk into the darkest night of insanity. He showed no feeling
at the moment of departure, and cared only for some toys; but all the
tenderness which had lain dormant in Ludwig&rsquo;s nature burst forth
at this moment. Those who were witness to his parting with his mad
brother were moved at the heart-broken sorrow he displayed.</p>
<p class="par">From this day the King became deeply solicitous about
his own health; he suffered from fear lest Otto&rsquo;s fate should
become his. A doctor had been careless enough to inform him that his
father had led a light life in his earliest youth. After he had learned
this fact, he attributed the greater number of his physical sufferings
to inherited tendency. The remembrance of his father became painful to
him, and he could not suppress bitter expressions with reference to
him. At the time of his ascent of the throne several persons had
thought to remark that his nerves were wanting in the power of
resistance. The celebrated French physician, Dr Morel, who had been
called to Munich in 1867, had had an opportunity of seeing the young
King. He had uttered the sadly prophetic words: &ldquo;His eyes are
sinisterly beautiful; future madness shines from them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The political events of 1870&ndash;71, and their
results, had increased his already painful feeling of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>contrast between his imagination and reality.
Signs were not wanting that his dream-life might have fatal results for
him. His nervous excitement became even more apparent when his
brother&rsquo;s malady broke out. In 1874 his condition was considered
so dangerous that it was talked of openly in his capital. The editor of
a Conservative newspaper publicly mentioned the report that the King
was insane. He was condemned to six months&rsquo; imprisonment for
<i lang="fr">l&egrave;se Majest&eacute;</i>, although he called as
witnesses several deputies of the Landtag, who declared on oath that
this topic had been discussed in the ale-halls of Munich.</p>
<p class="par">Megalomania, the traces of which at times were apparent,
had not yet penetrated so deeply into Ludwig&rsquo;s consciousness that
they affected more than certain of his actions; the fire was still
smouldering, though it threatened to burst out into flames. As yet his
power of will was strong enough to curb his imagination. As yet a
healthy mental current ran, and was to run for long, side by side with
the diseased one; as yet he could at times by restless activity bring
his unquiet mind to rest. He fought like a lion to avert the
misfortune, which he so greatly dreaded; but he fought alone. His lofty
conceptions had year by year deepened the cleft which a want of
understanding had dug between him and his mother. Circumstances had
parted him from Richard Wagner, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>friend whom he had
most loved. He had no confidant, hardly, indeed, anyone in whom he
placed confidence. There was no one who with a firm hand might have led
him away from his erroneous conceptions, no one who could obliterate
the impressions which made him superstitious and bitter.</p>
<p class="par">This King, who a few years before had awakened the
enthusiasm of all, became transformed into a heavy, corpulent, pallid
man, weary with the burden of his life. In the midst of the romantic
splendour with which he surrounded himself, he was tormented by the
thought of suicide. On stormy nights he would drive about the mountain
roads at a furious pace in his gilded coach, alone with his morbid
sensations and fancies.</p>
<p class="par">Only the deep blue eyes, with their expression of
<i>Schw&auml;rmerei</i> and their melancholy glance, remained to remind
the world of the handsome youth who had been the pride and hope of
Bavaria. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Review of the Troops in 1875&mdash;Crown Prince
Friedrich of Prussia</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Bavarian people had accustomed themselves to
Ludwig&rsquo;s peculiarities. Foreign states and peoples still regarded
his ways and actions as signs of genius. The King himself seemed to be
indifferent as to the impression his conduct made upon others.</p>
<p class="par">Military pageants had never interested him; he had had
from his childhood a morbid dread of firearms and of war. On the return
of the troops in 1871 he had not even glanced at the wounded&mdash;not
because his heart was wanting in sympathy for them, but because his
nerves could not endure the sight. Great, therefore, was the general
astonishment when it was announced in the summer of 1875 that it was
the King&rsquo;s intention to hold a review. People found it difficult
to think that he would make this exception from his hermit habits.</p>
<p class="par">The report, however, was not contradicted. The troops
stationed at the different garrisons were already out at the autumn
man&oelig;uvres when 14,000 men were recalled to the capital. Ludwig
wished to show the World that he had the chief <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>command of his army. His intention had hardly
been made known before thousands of strangers flocked to Munich to see
him. On Sunday, the 15th of August, 1875, all the streets were filled
to overflowing. The Monarch&rsquo;s brilliant suite took up its
position between the entrance to the royal gardens and the Feldherren
Halle. When he rode up on his white horse that beautiful Sunday
morning, at the head of his staff, the crowds were thrilled with love
and admiration for him.</p>
<p class="par">The King no longer possessed his fascinating beauty; but
his features were still refined and noble, and his eyes full of soul,
and brilliant as before. Despite his youth, he had become very stout,
but being tall, his figure was as imposing as ever. He had only to show
himself to arouse enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="par">With the dignity which was his by birth, and with the
fascinating amiability which he displayed in his best moments, he bowed
in all directions. The troops were forbidden to greet him with cheers,
but no such regulation restricted the citizens. The enthusiasm
increased like an avalanche; it spread from street to street, giving
unmistakable indication of how dearly he was still beloved. At the
conclusion of the review he rode up to Princess Gisela,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2111src" href="#xd21e2111" name="xd21e2111src">1</a>
who had been present at it, sitting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>in the King&rsquo;s
state carriage. At this moment he was surrounded from all sides. His
servants endeavoured to hold the crowd back, but he hastened to prevent
them. It was with the utmost trouble that a way was made for him when
at a foot&rsquo;s pace he returned to the city. So overwhelming was the
enthusiasm that he felt himself constrained to write the same day, in
his own hand, a letter of thanks for all the proofs of loyalty and love
which he had met with. This was the last time he gave the citizens of
Munich an opportunity of doing homage to him; the last time that his
heart proudly beat time with those of his subjects.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, this bright day, so full of feeling, was
by no means the outcome of noble thought: the German Crown Prince was
in the habit of holding a review every autumn of the Bavarian troops.
Jealousy of him had caused the lonely King to appear once more before
the world.</p>
<p class="par">At the return of the troops in 1871 his displeasure with
Friedrich had been very apparent. It had not grown less with the course
of years. Ludwig II. suffered more deeply under the supremacy of
Prussia than any of the other princes because his kingdom was larger
than that of any other prince, and because he was morbid and his pride
wounded. While his Ministers in 1870&ndash;71 were spinning out the
negotiations respecting the federation of the German States, Friedrich
had uttered words of anger against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>Bavaria of which its King had
not remained in ignorance. He looked upon the Crown Prince&rsquo;s
annual visit to his kingdom as an insult; and he was possessed by the
morbid conviction that the latter, when Emperor, would drive him out of
his dominions. &ldquo;It is not pleasant to be swallowed up,&rdquo; he
often repeated. Wilhelm I. had, in 1872, sent him the Order of the
Black Eagle; but the envoy conveying it had been unable to gain an
audience of the King, despite the earnest representations of the
Prussian Minister at Munich. At last, however, Ludwig was persuaded to
send a letter of thanks. He wrote that &ldquo;it would give him
pleasure to receive the Emperor&rsquo;s Order at a later date, when he
was feeling less fatigued; for the time being he was over-tired and
could not fix any day&rdquo;!</p>
<p class="par">Still, he by no means cherished unfriendly feelings
towards the old Emperor. During the last years of his life he mentioned
the attempts to assassinate the latter as one of the reasons for his
own distaste for mixing with the world. And when Wilhelm, accompanied
by the Grand Duchess of Baden, visited Bayreuth, in order to be present
at a Wagner festival, he sent his confidential secretary to arrange
everything in as pleasant a manner as possible for him and his
daughter. Wilhelm, on his side, had only friendly feelings towards
Ludwig. He repeatedly expressed his regret that the King of Bavaria
withdrew so much from the world; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>and he never forgot the
services he had done him and his country. But the King of Prussia was
three times the age of the King of Bavaria; he was, moreover, a soldier
from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, and of any real
understanding between them there could be little possibility, since
Ludwig by no means shared the enthusiasm which was generally felt at
the reconstitution of the German Empire, and was weary of the continued
praise at his attitude in the years 1870&ndash;71. He was a Bavarian
before all else. Often he expressed himself: &ldquo;I am honoured only
by the colours of my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crown Prince Friedrich was friendly and straightforward
in manner, and he made a favourable impression on the Bavarians. It is,
however, known beyond a doubt that he repaid the King&rsquo;s jealousy
with contempt. To those with whom he was on terms of confidence he
called Ludwig &ldquo;<i lang="fr">Le roi fain&eacute;ant</i>.&rdquo; He
was of a lively nature, and he did not always weigh his words. After a
journey of inspection he said to some Bavarian officers who had
assembled in order to bid him farewell: &ldquo;In ten years&rsquo; time
you will belong entirely to us.&rdquo; This utterance was repeated to
the King, who was exceedingly annoyed at it. His Minister at the
Prussian court received instructions to request an explanation from the
Crown Prince. Friedrich made answer that he had only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>referred to the military alliance; but Ludwig
was not satisfied with this reply.</p>
<p class="par">At the beginning of the seventies the German Crown
Prince and his wife desired, for reasons of health, to spend the summer
at Berchtesgaden. The King hastened to put hindrances in the way of the
contemplated visit, giving as an excuse for not receiving them, that
his villa there was to be used as a residence for his insane brother
Otto. A lady of the German aristocracy who owned a house at
Berchtesgaden offered the Crown Prince hers. Ludwig now suddenly
changed his mind. The following characteristic letter shows that for
the moment he regretted his want of friendliness:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">My dear
Friend</span>,</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I see from your kind letter that you have already
decided to make use of the house offered you by Fr&auml;ulein von
Waldenburg. I am really very sorry for this; the more so that Otto,
according to the doctors&rsquo; orders, is to continue his cure at
Nymphenburg, and my villa at Berchtesgaden would therefore, dear
cousin, have been entirely at the disposal of yourself and your
family.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I cherish the hope that the stay in the strong
mountain air will give the Crown Princess and your children pleasure
and strength.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I conclude with the wish that you may all like
beautiful Berchtesgaden. Praying that you <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>will kiss the hand of
the Crown Princess for me, I remain in old friendship,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;Your faithful affectionate cousin,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ludwig</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">When Friedrich came to Munich in later years he always
stayed there incognito. He visited the art and industrial museums, and
received some of his old companions-in-arms; but he never visited the
King, nor did the King ever seek him. The antipathy grew on both sides.
Unfortunately, Ludwig was at no pains to conceal his feelings; he spoke
often and unreservedly of his bitterness towards this member of the
Prussian Imperial House. His <i>entourage</i> did not look upon it as a
duty to preserve silence with regard to what they had heard. The
King&rsquo;s words sometimes journeyed <i>vi&acirc;</i> Vienna to
Berlin, and the effect made itself felt in due course. It was in 1874,
at the railway station at Munich, that he greeted the Emperor Wilhelm
for the last time. After this date the &ldquo;victorious old man&rdquo;
also travelled incognito through Bavaria when he visited Gastein in the
summers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h2 class="main">King Ludwig and the Empress Elisabeth</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ludwig&rsquo;s spite against a single member of
the House of Hohenzollern destroyed the good relations with his
relatives in Berlin. By way of off-set, the sympathy he felt for the
Empress Elizabeth had the effect of causing his relations with the
House of Hapsburg to be very friendly.</p>
<p class="par">His betrothal to his cousin, Sophie Charlotte, had left
behind it bitter memories. Although it was he who had dissolved the
connection, and although she would hardly have been capable of making
him happy, it is a fact that he became the slave of melancholy after
the engagement was broken off. The Duchess had much to forgive him; and
yet it appeared to the sick King, who condemned himself to loneliness,
that it was he who was the injured party. In one of the rooms which he
usually occupied hung the portrait of a woman, over which he had caused
a thick silken veil to be hung. He would stand sunk in thought before
this picture, walking slowly when he turned away, as if it cost him an
effort to leave it. No outside personage was ever permitted to see it,
and no one knew whom it represented. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>It was supposed that
it might be a portrait of Marie Antoinette of France, for whom he
cherished a great admiration; but many also thought that the painting
represented the Duchesse d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, whom he had never
forgotten.</p>
<p class="par">Nearly the whole of the royal house had taken the side
of his former <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, and were with reason annoyed at
his fickleness. In spite of the wrong which had been done the ducal
house, one of Sophie&rsquo;s brothers and one of her sisters had been
indulgent towards him. Duke Karl Teodor, the oculist, had scrutinised
his cousin with the eye of a doctor; he had found excuses for his
action in his diseased mental condition. Elizabeth of Austria had
understanding even of aspects of his character which could not possibly
have been sympathetic to her, and she was attracted by qualities in him
which had displeased and alarmed her sister.</p>
<p class="par">It is difficult to say whether it was Sophie&rsquo;s
likeness to Elizabeth which had awakened his feelings for the Duchess,
or whether a half-unconscious longing for his former betrothed knit the
tie firmer between the Empress and himself. It is remarkable, in any
case, that the King, who was otherwise so reserved towards women,
should have formed a lasting friendship with her. The outward likeness
between the two sisters was very great; the inward harmony, however,
was not in the same proportion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>Despite her beauty and her
carefully developed talents, Sophie was an ordinary woman, whereas
Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind was rich, though her soul was crushed. Hardly
judged by many, understood by few, and yet admired by most, she was the
woman, if anybody could have done so, to have fitted into the King of
Bavaria&rsquo;s life. Both had the same restlessness in their blood, at
the same time as they had both a need for solitude. The &ldquo;horror
of the crowd&rdquo; which dominated him in so great a degree was also a
characteristic of her. They were burdened with the same morbid
tendencies. Even in their exterior there was similarity between the two
cousins, who were gifted with such unusual and spiritual beauty.
Neither of them had known the joys of youth; the sceptre had been
placed in their hands while they were yet undeveloped children. The
power which too early both had become possessed of had in both
developed an unwillingness to sacrifice a tittle of their convenience.
Ludwig never opened the door to the deep and unusual qualities of his
personality; Elizabeth, too, kept her inmost thoughts in conscious
shade. However eagerly the crowd might seek, among the hum of reports
which were ever afloat, it never knew for certain what it was that
inwardly moved them. But they found mutual healing in opening their
hearts to one another on the unfulfilled wishes and hidden
disappointments which the world did not see. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Their inherited nervous sufferings were the sorrow-laden
undercurrent of their lives. Insanity which was inherent in their race
was to both of them a threatening spectre, which, sooner or later,
would attack them too. But in the case of Ludwig this fear had in a
greater degree than in the case of Elizabeth weakened the power of
will. Proud almost to the verge of megalomania, they were,
nevertheless, friendly towards the country people they met with. By
nature they were exceedingly generous; but the sufferings of their
neighbour did not, either in him or her, drive away their thoughts from
themselves. Both Ludwig and Elizabeth were eccentric in their
sympathies and antipathies. Elizabeth was unhappy in her marriage; she
sought a panacea for love in friendships with women. Ludwig could
suddenly, and apparently without reason, take up with men who were far
inferior to him in character. Both, as a rule, were disappointed in,
and quickly tired of, these favourites for a day. Both the King and the
Empress fled to the world of books, and when they met their literary
interests bound them still faster together. A result of their mutual
affection was that they exercised influence one upon the other.
Elizabeth was older and had more knowledge of the world; she did not
exceed her cousin in intelligence, though she may have done so in
energy. Her power over him was, therefore, greater <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>than
his over her. The Empress&rsquo;s influence was not altogether for
good. She impressed upon Ludwig that &ldquo;one can do everything one
likes,&rdquo; and the young Wittelsbach was very receptive to this kind
of teaching. Where it might have been good and useful, he was, on the
contrary, less willing to follow her advice: the Empress went early to
bed, rose every morning at five, and went out of doors. The King spent
his nights in music and reading, and not till day began to break did he
retire to rest. Both had been passionately fond of riding, but had been
obliged to give up this sport. She went instead walks of many miles,
whereas he took his daily constitutional in a closed carriage.</p>
<p class="par">Elizabeth spent part of her summers in Feldafing, in the
vicinity of Ludwig&rsquo;s castles. They met one another by appointment
on the Roseninsel, in the lake of Starnberg; or, as not seldom
happened, she would suddenly appear in his study at Schloss Berg or
Neuschwanstein, and remain sitting many hours with him. She brought
with her a stream of beauty and harmony into his quiet apartments. Even
in his last darkened hours, when otherwise he received nobody, he liked
to have her visits.</p>
<p class="par">Prince Leopold of Bavaria had married in 1873 her eldest
daughter. Ludwig had on this occasion emerged from his customary
retirement. Princess Gisela was one of his few women relations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>who could boast of his amiability. Flattering as
this might be, it was at times exceedingly inconvenient; for the King,
who turned night into day, sent her presents and bouquets of flowers in
the night. He would not alter his habits either for her or her
mother&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p class="par">The Empress&rsquo;s youngest daughter, Marie Valerie,
expressed the wish to make her &ldquo;uncle&rsquo;s&rdquo;
acquaintance, and Elizabeth was at some pains to induce him to receive
her favourite child. But he would not be disturbed in his quiet.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why the Empress is always telling me about
her Valerie,&rdquo; he said to one of those near him. &ldquo;Valerie
wants to see me, she says; but I don&rsquo;t at all want to see her
Valerie.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">King Ludwig and Queen Marie</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A picture very often to be seen in Bavaria is one
representing Maximilian II. and his family in the garden at
Hohenschwangau. The Queen is sitting with Prince Otto on her lap, and
the King, standing beside her, has laid his hand on the Crown
Prince&rsquo;s head. He is in the full prime of his manhood; his wife
is radiant with happiness and beauty.</p>
<p class="par">The lapse of a few years had transformed this family
life in the Bavarian royal castle. The bright and happy Queen had
become a widow, the proud mother a <i>Mater Dolorosa</i>. Prince Otto,
the child of her heart, was hopelessly insane. The admiration which
Ludwig had excited, the great hopes of which at the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e2214" title="Source: begining">beginning</span> of his reign
he had been the centre, could not outweigh her fearful anxiety for his
future.</p>
<p class="par">Until the middle of the seventies, she and her eldest
son had been in the habit of residing at Hohenschwangau at the same
time, the Queen-mother using the ground floor of the castle, and the
young King the first floor. Though they both loved the place equally
well, and though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165"
name="pb165">165</a>]</span>Hohenschwangau was Queen Marie&rsquo;s
dower house, her son&rsquo;s secluded life caused an alteration in this
arrangement also: in later years he went to Linderhof when she came to
Hohenschwangau, and upon his return she retired to Elbingen-Alp. When
they met he showed his mother great respect; and when, as sometimes
happened, disharmonies occurred between them he restrained his
annoyance. But the Queen-mother&rsquo;s bourgeois view of life never
found the key to his composite nature. Repulsed time after time, she
relinquished the hope of ever winning his confidence, though love still
lived in the hearts of both.</p>
<p class="par">Exactly opposite Hohenschwangau stood an enormous
pine-tree on a projecting rock; lighted up by the declining sun it
reminded the Queen-mother of a Christmas-tree. One winter, when they
were both living at their favourite castle, son and mother kept
Christmas Eve together. The gifts distributed, Ludwig led his mother to
a balcony window. He drew aside the heavy velvet curtains. In the
snow-covered landscape without, glittered a magnificent Christmas-tree;
it was the spruce fir on the rock, which he had caused to be decorated
with lights in order to give her pleasure.</p>
<p class="par">Marie of Bavaria loved the country population; she often
and willingly entered into personal relations with them. The customs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>of the peasantry, but above all their deep,
childlike sense of religion, exercised an attraction on her pious mind.
By birth a Hohenzollern, she had been brought up in the Lutheran
teaching; her own mother had been a strict Protestant. As long as
Bavaria had been a kingdom its Queen had belonged to this Church, which
the Protestant portion of the population regarded as a support and
help. Disappointment was great when it was made known that the
Queen-mother intended to enter the Roman Catholic Church. Her relatives
in Prussia were also painfully surprised; her sister, the Princess of
Hesse-Darmstadt, even journeyed to Hohenschwangau at the last minute
for the purpose of endeavouring to dissuade her from her resolution.
The German Emperor, whose heart she had ever been very near, made
representations of a like nature. But life had brought too many trials
for her to be led away by the pressure of others from what she felt to
be a matter of conscience. Sad, but not bitter, she retired from the
world and from her people, whose respect and sympathy followed her in
her loneliness.</p>
<p class="par">In the little chapel at Wallenhofen, in all quietness,
she changed her religion.</p>
<p class="par">There is no doubt that many hard struggles had gone
before this step. It was thought that King Ludwig did not approve of
her action because the Protestants of his country so greatly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>lamented it. But with his love of free-will, he
would not place obstacles in the way of her desire. At a religious
festival in Munich, he himself informed the public of his
mother&rsquo;s decision. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href=

<h2 class="main">State and Church&mdash;Ignaz von
D&ouml;llinger&mdash;Ludwig&rsquo;s Letters to his old Tutor</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One Christmas night in the seventies, Ludwig II.
was present with the Queen-mother and the royal Princes at the midnight
Mass in the court church at Munich. In the midst of the service he laid
his prayer-book aside. He threw himself on his knees, hid his face, and
sobbed aloud. His mother regarded him anxiously, and called her
brother-in-law, Prince Luitpold, who was sitting in the box next to
them. The King rose to his feet and hid his head on her breast; and she
and his uncle conducted him to his rooms.</p>
<p class="par">A few days previously an execution had taken place,
which had made a deep impression on him. A Neapolitan youth, twenty
years of age, who had committed a murder in his country, had been
condemned to death. The unhappy parents had sent a heartrending appeal
to the young King, who had wished to reprieve him; but his Ministers
had opposed his intention.</p>
<p class="par">In his later years, Ludwig seldom attended divine
service in Munich; but during his residences at Berg, he went regularly
to a little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>church which had been built in the park there.
At the castle of Neuschwanstein there was an altar and a <i lang=
"fr">prie-dieu</i> in his sleeping apartment. He was in the habit of
hearing Mass in the neighbouring chapel; and no person was refused
admittance because the King was praying in it. When he visited the
small village churches in the highlands, he would often kneel unknown
amid those at prayer. At Ober-Ammergau he was so affected by the
passion plays, that he caused a magnificent marble group of the
Crucifixion to be erected in that town. Once when driving he met a
priest carrying the sacrament; he alighted, knelt upon the highroad and
prayed. He was God-fearing, but very tolerant; and he hated
confessional dissensions.</p>
<p class="par">In affairs of state he preserved a quiet and certain
view, not the less so where ecclesiastical matters were concerned; but
the relations between the Papal power and his Government were anything
but peaceful. Ludwig had a modern conception of the Church&rsquo;s
relation to the State; he desired that the schools should be freed from
the yoke of the Church. The reforms of the Government in this domain
became the source of violent skirmishes.</p>
<p class="par">The Catholic Church party, which adorned itself with the
often misused name of &ldquo;National,&rdquo; worked up a strong
feeling against him and his Ministers. In reality, this party
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>was less national than the other; for the
Catholic Church is international in its principle and in its entire
organisation, the threads being collected in Rome from the Catholic
communities in all parts of the world! Nor was there unity among the
Catholic clergy themselves. One of the heads of the Church in Bavaria
at that time was Ignaz von D&ouml;llinger. He had been Ludwig&rsquo;s
teacher, and one of the few whom Ludwig in his youth had really cared
about. The Dean was among the most learned theologians of the last
century. He had in 1863 published a book, &ldquo;<i lang=
"de">Pabstfabeln des Mittelalters</i>,&rdquo; which had brought him
into bad odour with the Romish <i>curia</i>. In spite of threats from
Rome he quietly continued the way which his truth-loving spirit and his
scientific <span class="corr" id="xd21e2262" title=
"Source: reresearches">researches</span> pointed out to him. In 1864
Pius IX. had issued the so-called &ldquo;Syllabus,&rdquo; in which he
vindicated and defined the medi&aelig;val conception of the
Church&rsquo;s supremacy over the State. The Pope meant by his action
to prepare for the dogma of his Infallibility. D&ouml;llinger made this
the object of scathing criticism. His writings did not indeed influence
the unenlightened masses, who received the Holy Father&rsquo;s message
with blind obedience, but within scientific circles in the Catholic
world the Dean&rsquo;s utterances made a deep impression. Munich became
the centre of the opposition, and D&ouml;llinger, as a matter of
course, became its leader. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The suppressed embitterment of which he had long been
the object at Rome was now transformed into open and violent
persecution. During these struggles King Ludwig held his protecting
hand over his old teacher,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2268src" href=

<p class="par">On the 18th of July the same year Pius IX. announced his
dogma of Infallibility. A few weeks afterwards the thunderbolt of
excommunication struck Ignaz von D&ouml;llinger. It is greatly to King
Ludwig&rsquo;s honour that he still continued to support him. On the
28th of February, 1871, he sent him a letter in which, among other
things, he says:</p>

<p class="par">The King later was in the habit of asking D&ouml;llinger
for information regarding religious works, and several times sent
messengers to him to require his explanation of certain passages.</p>
<p class="par">Johannes von Lutz, the son of a village schoolmaster,
but early well known as a prominent lawyer, had become Prince
Hohenlohe&rsquo;s successor as Premier. He also was persecuted by the
Catholic Church party. Ludwig ennobled him, creating him a baron, and
always protected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"

opposed the Government in 1883, he sent him the following
characteristic autograph letter:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="par">&ldquo;I have with regret followed the obstructions
which have been placed, during the last few months, in the way of my

solicitude for the welfare of their country. I feel myself called upon

colleagues, who have been summoned by me to be the counsellors of the
Crown, will hold out firmly in the future, and with all your strength
champion my rights.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;With particular regard to the Church&rsquo;s

<p class="par">&ldquo;But I am equally decided that my Government now
and in the future must resist all attempts to undermine the undoubted
rights of the State, which will bring State and Church into a fatal
position.</p>

my will, I assure you and your colleagues of my warm recognition of
your faithful resistance under difficult circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h2 class="main">Ludwig II. in Daily Life</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When Bavaria in 1880 celebrated the seven
hundredth anniversary of the House of Wittelsbach, the King declined to
have any festivities. He issued a proclamation from his highlands in
which he declared that he felt himself one with his people, and at the
same time expressed the wish that a charitable institution might be
founded in honour of the day. His decision not to show himself aroused,
and justly, very great disapproval.</p>
<p class="par">Some years prior to this occurrence the Palatinate kept
the anniversary of its fifty years&rsquo; union with Bavaria. Ludwig
had promised to be present. At the last moment he sent an excuse,
although this circle had proved its loyalty to him in the most
brilliant manner during the war of 1866. He absented himself under the
pretext of illness, which, however, did not prevent him from starting
for Switzerland the same day to visit his friend Richard Wagner.</p>
<p class="par">The last period of his life excepted, he performed
punctually his duties of governing; and he was particular that they
should never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>be postponed. Apart from representation, which
he declined, even his opponents were obliged to confess that for a
great number of years he faithfully fulfilled his kingly duties. At the
beginning of his reign he had been in the habit of rising early; but it
was not long before the division of his time became exceedingly
strange. He now seldom showed himself before midday. When at his
country residences the documents which it was necessary for him to sign
were sent to him by express messenger, who left Munich every morning
and returned every evening. As a rule, his secretary accompanied him to
these seats, and no inconvenience was remarked in the different
departments on account of his absence. During the warm summer months
the affairs of state were at times conducted in the open air. Tables
and chairs were arranged on a lawn covered with Turkey carpets. Large
bouquets of flowers were placed before the King&rsquo;s chair. The
secretary read the documents out loud. The King made his decisions,
said good-morning, and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The
secretary&rsquo;s position was not an easy one. When Ludwig was under
the influence of his ill-humours he would be annoyed at the most
harmless looks and expressions, and often sent him letters late at
night in which he demanded explanation for a single unguarded word. At
the same time, he was eager to give him pleasure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>when
he was satisfied with him, frequently surprising him and his family
with photographs, books, and other articles of value.</p>
<p class="par">When residing at Hohenschwangau during the autumn
months, the King was in the habit of driving out every night in his
handsome carriage, or his sledge which was decorated with allegorical
figures. His equipage rushed like a hurricane through the villages and
the dark woods, past snow-covered mountains and deep precipices. On
these excursions his life was sometimes in danger. One stormy night the
out-rider, who could not distinguish the road from the chasm beside it,
was seized with panic, and throwing his torch away, rode blindly
forward. Ludwig&rsquo;s life was saved as by a miracle. When in Munich
he would drive every day to the &ldquo;English Garden,&rdquo; where he
was in the habit of walking quite alone under the old trees, with his
hat pulled down over his eyes. He was possessed by a morbid fear of
assassination, and this explains the fact that he was always
accompanied by mounted <i>gendarmes</i> when he drove through his
capital. On the few occasions when he showed himself in public he
walked exceedingly stiffly, with his head thrown back. Those whose
sentiments towards him were unfriendly looked upon this as a sign of
megalomania; the greater number of others considered his carriage proud
and kingly. The truth of the matter was that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>he
had a bad carriage, and an uncertain and tottering gait, which he thus
endeavoured to hide. When he talked with strangers he always allowed
them to stand at some distance from him, because it displeased him that
they should remark his bad teeth; he was jealous of his reputation as
the handsomest monarch of Europe.</p>
<p class="par">His meals he nearly always partook of alone at an
inconvenient table in his study. When he gave audience in the
afternoons, he would sometimes eat while the secretary held his
lectures. As he was never punctual, his meals had to be kept hot for
hours together. As many as twelve courses were served, but, as a rule,
he ate only of one. It has been said of him that during his latter
years he indulged to excess in strong drinks. This is not in accord
with the truth. As a rule, he drank only Rhine wine with water, or
champagne, in which fresh scented violets had been placed. Heady wines
he never drank, as they induced in him a rush of blood to the head. His
valet had orders to place a glass of cognac on a table by his bedside
before the King retired for the night; but, as a rule, it stood
untouched the following day.</p>
<p class="par">To give presents was a positive mania with Ludwig. It
was his delight at Christmas to surprise everybody, from princes and
princesses to every single servant of his household, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>gifts. Nor did he forget old teachers whom he
had been fond of, or those whom he had met on his way and liked. Long
before Christmas he would cause inquiries to be made for articles of
the most varied description, and these were sent to Hohenschwangau or
Neuschwanstein, where his rooms were transformed into a bazaar.
Masterpieces in industrial art ordered by King Ludwig were executed at
Munich, in Paris, and in Switzerland. As the <i>motifs</i> of the gifts
he distributed were often taken from the poetical tournament of the
thirteenth century, and at other times were in the fashion of the
sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, those who worked for
Ludwig became conversant with the most varied styles. He was so
impatient to see the works of art that he demanded their immediate
completion. Many heads and hands were fully occupied in executing his
orders, and he contributed much to the development of art
industries.</p>
<p class="par">The sums with which he rewarded insignificant services
were, like his other expenses, little in proportion to the Bavarian
King&rsquo;s income. In the case of accidents and charitable purposes
he was seldom appealed to in vain; but far greater was his generosity
performed in secret. Out of his own purse he moreover paid as long as
he lived all the pensions and assistance which his father had granted.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Ludwig and Richard Wagner&mdash;The King&rsquo;s Visit
to Bayreuth</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As long as Richard Wagner had lived in Munich it
had only been necessary for him to express a wish with regard to the
performance of his works, for the King at once to fulfil it. After his
departure he had at first in Hans von B&uuml;low a substitute whom he
could safely trust. But when he too left Bavaria the matter grew more
difficult. Baron von Perfall became the manager of the Hof Theater.
Although he made a positive <i>culte</i> of Wagner&rsquo;s works, and
during his tenure of the office, which lasted for twenty-five years,
performed his operas 742 times, the old order of things was changed
during his leadership.</p>
<p class="par">On the 25th of June 1868, the day after the dress
rehearsal of <i lang="de">Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg</i>,
Perfall received a letter from Wagner in which he announced his
intention of &ldquo;retiring from all connection with the Hof
Theater.&rdquo; Almost simultaneously Ludwig and Wagner were seen side
by side for the last time in Munich. It was at the first performance of
the <i lang="de">Meistersinger</i>. The representation was brilliant,
Hans von B&uuml;low conducting with energy, and entirely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>in
the master&rsquo;s spirit. The King sat in his great box. He caused
Wagner to be summoned to it.</p>
<p class="par">The composer was enthusiastically recalled after the
first act, but did not appear on the stage because he had been unable
to find his way thither from the royal box. The performance was
proceeded with, and at its conclusion the applause broke forth with
redoubled vigour. Wagner, who was sitting by the King&rsquo;s side,
rose and bowed to the public from the <i lang="de"><span class="corr"
id="xd21e2406" title="Source: Keiserloge">Kaiserloge</span></i>, an act
which occasioned much annoyance. The unfavourable criticism which his
friendship for the poet-musician was always calling forth had an
unfortunate influence on Ludwig&rsquo;s mental condition, as well as
greatly wounding his pride.</p>
<p class="par">Wagner, who had visited Bayreuth in his youth, had
preserved a pleasant impression of this town, situated so far from the
noise of industry and the distracting influences of the outer world.
Returning thither in 1871, a warm friendship sprang up between him and
its inhabitants, who wished to keep him in their midst. The
Margrave&rsquo;s large theatre had for many years been unused. He
agreed with the leading men of the town to take this house, although it
was hardly suitable for his purpose. The inhabitants now offered him a
building site which must in every way have been attractive to him. His
scheme of raising a temple of art <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>in the little town amid the
Bavarian mountains was received with delight by his adherents and
friends, who did all in their power to support the undertaking. Ludwig
also stood by his side, a loyal helper, during the struggle which
ensued before his theatre was finally complete. The foundation-stone
was laid in 1872. The King telegraphed: &ldquo;From my inmost soul I
express to you, my dearest friend, my warmest and sincerest
congratulations on the occasion of this day, which is of import to the
whole of Germany. Success and blessing accompany the great work! I am
to-day more than ever with you in thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Richard Wagner&rsquo;s letters to Emil Heckel give an
insight into the immense difficulties which he and his admirers had to
overcome. There was in 1873 a money crisis extending over the whole of
Germany and Austria. Banks which had promised credit were unable to
meet their promises, and this delayed the realisation of his scheme. He
had always calculated upon the King&rsquo;s assistance. On the 16th of
January he wrote to Heckel that he had requested &ldquo;his
ever-generous protector&rdquo; to guarantee a loan, but that the
latter, for some reason unknown to him, had refused his
assistance.&mdash;A German poet had written an eulogistic ode in
Ludwig&rsquo;s honour and had requested Wagner to set it to music, but
the latter, unaware that the King knew the poem, had coldly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>refused to do this. Ludwig had been offended. He
could not, however, long be angry with his friend; already in February
in the same year he gave the desired security. The first
&ldquo;Niebelungen-cycle&rdquo; was given in Bayreuth from the 13th to
the 30th of August 1876. It was repeated three times before an
enthusiastic audience, among whom were the Emperor of Germany, the
Grand Dukes of Weimar and Baden, the Emperor of Brazil, the Grand Duke
Constantine of Russia, and many other royal personages, as well as
literary and artistic celebrities from all countries.</p>
<p class="par">The King of Bavaria, who was seldom present at anything
but separate performances, determined to visit Bayreuth, despite the
fact that this would necessitate his appearing in public. He drove
direct from Chiemsee to his hunting-box outside the town. Only Wagner
was there to receive him. He met his old friend with warmth, and bade
him seat himself beside him in the carriage. Although he made a detour
each evening in order to avoid the crowd, he was, both inside and
outside the theatre, the object of enthusiastic ovations. He
endeavoured to avoid them, but again and again had to come to the front
of his box and bow his acknowledgments. He looked ill and depressed.
Wagner was the only person with whom he conversed, but he paid no visit
to his private residence, and he left Bayreuth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>unattended and as quietly as he had come.</p>
<p class="par">The German, French, and English press took up a cool
attitude with regard to the festival. It could not be denied that it
had been great and successful, but it was said that the
&ldquo;Ring&rdquo; was long. The performances showed a deficit of
16,000 marks.</p>
<p class="par">The poet-musician was in the greatest straits for money.
His friends advised him again to address himself to the King. It was
his opinion, however, that he had already taken greater advantage of
his protector&rsquo;s generosity than he ought to have done. As he saw
no other way of paying his debts, he sold the &ldquo;Ring,&rdquo; on
which he had worked for nearly thirty years, and which the theatre at
Bayreuth had been built for, to a theatre agent. Hard as the sale must
have been to him, it helped him over his difficulties. The
&ldquo;Ring&rdquo; made a triumphal progress across the chief stages of
Germany. Divergent art tendencies were agreed in admiration of his
work, and his name shone with greater lustre than before. Since that
time enthusiastic hosts of listeners have made pilgrimages from all
parts of Europe and America to the little town, to do homage to the
great poet-composer and his works.</p>
<p class="par">With the lapse of years Ludwig&rsquo;s admiration for
his person had somewhat cooled, and during the visits to Bayreuth no
trace had been visible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>of his earlier enthusiastic
attachment. But if the friendship no longer had the warmth of youth it
was by no means dead. In the year 1879 Wagner wrote to Emil Heckel of a
&ldquo;kind letter which the King had sent him.&rdquo; The
master&rsquo;s works had taken deep root in the King&rsquo;s mind. In
1881 he became the patron of the Bayreuth festival. He ordered that the
orchestra and chorus of the Hof Theater should be for two months in the
year at the disposal of Richard Wagner. In 1882, when <i>Parsifal</i>
was given for the first time, he expressed a wish for a private
performance at which he could be present unnoticed. He changed his
mind, however, at the last moment, perhaps because the German Crown
Prince was to be among the audience. Some time afterwards
<i>Parsifal</i> was played in Munich, with the assistance of the same
artists who had sung at Bayreuth. After the first rehearsals of this
opera had taken place Wagner wrote a treatise in letter form on his
person and works, which he sent to Ludwig. It began with the following
words:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will not write another note. My work is
complete! I have successfully and victoriously accomplished my mission,
despite the hostile onrush of a world of opponents.&rdquo; This was one
of the last letters from the composer-poet to this King, who had been
to him more than a friend.</p>
<p class="par">The poet-musician used every year to visit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>Munich, where his protector received him with
unchanged kindness. In 1882 he came thither for the last time. He
requested as usual an audience of the King, but Ludwig begged to be
excused from receiving him, as he was indisposed. On the 13th of
February, 1883, Richard Wagner died at Venice. Five thousand telegrams
were sent to all parts of the world to announce the ill tidings. One of
the first came to Ludwig. He violently reproached himself for not
having received him. One of his aides-de-camp went on his behalf to
Venice to lay a wreath of Alpine roses on the composer&rsquo;s coffin.
A special train brought the deceased, his widow, and a number of
friends to Bayreuth. At the frontier the King&rsquo;s secretary was
waiting to accompany the coffin and show the last honour to the
poet-musician.</p>
<p class="par">Music, which before had been Ludwig&rsquo;s greatest
joy, was from this time forth not permitted at any of his castles,
because it so painfully reminded him of the friend of his youth. All
the pianos on which he had played were draped with crape. The dead
man&rsquo;s works still had such an effect on him that after every
performance of <i>Parsifal</i> he caused a Mass to be said in his
castle. And after the King&rsquo;s death, busts, portraits, and other
mementos of Richard Wagner were found everywhere in his favourite
rooms. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">King Ludwig and the Artists of the Stage and
Canvas</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A French journalist who saw Ludwig II. in his
youth, has said: &ldquo;His beauty belongs to the romantic type. His
dark eyes are dreamy and full of enthusiasm. His handsome face, elegant
personality, and dignified bearing at once win admiration and sympathy.
He is in possession of all the graces of youth, its illusions and
enthusiasm; but at the same time he offers an example of that need for
change which belongs to youth. His subjects look upon him as a fool.
They are mistaken: he is only foolish on one point&mdash;namely, where
music is in question.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The King passionately loved Wagner&rsquo;s operas.
Concerts, on the other hand, he seldom attended, but he often invited
opera singers of both sexes to sing at his castles. Shortly after his
accession an actor by the name of Emil Rohde was engaged by the Munich
Hof Theater, and won in a high degree his Majesty&rsquo;s approval as
Don Carlos, Ferdinand in Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Kabale und Liebe</i>, Max
Piccolomini, and Mortimer. Rohde was one of the first artists in whom
Ludwig showed particular interest. At the beginning of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>sojourn in the Bavarian capital he was often
summoned to the Palace. After the first unabridged performance of
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Wilhelm Tell</i> the King sent him the following
autograph letter:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear
Rohde</span>,</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have surpassed all my expectations. I shall
always remember with the greatest delight the beautiful hours which we
passed together this winter. Yes, you must come again!</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;I remain always your very gracious
King,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ludwig</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The invitations, however, were not repeated. Ludwig came
to have other interests and other favourites.</p>
<p class="par">The tenor, Franz Ignaz Nachbaur, was showered with
proofs of favour. He had begun his career as a chorus singer, but a
Swiss art m&aelig;cena had caused him to be educated under Lamperti at
Milan. In 1868 he received an invitation to appear as Walther von
Stolzing in the <i lang="de">Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg</i>. He
was not, as a matter of fact, a very intelligent singer; but he
surpassed all his colleagues by his exceedingly handsome exterior, and
by the pure tenor tones of his voice. Ludwig appointed him chamber
singer. After every new <i>r&ocirc;le</i> he sent him handsome
presents, among other things a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>Lohengrin equipment of
wrought silver, and a number of diamond pins and rings. Nachbaur, who
was in the habit of exhibiting them with childlike delight, was in
consequence given the soubriquet of &ldquo;Brilliant Nazzi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In addition to Wagner&rsquo;s musical works, the King
took pleasure in hearing Lortzing&rsquo;s, Kreutzer&rsquo;s,
Verdi&rsquo;s, and Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s operas. The day after he had
been present for the first time at Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s opera,
<i>Guido et Guivera</i>, he sent for Nachbaur, and, to the astonishment
of the artist, though he had never set eyes on the music, sang through
the whole of the great <i>aria</i>. When he had finished, he said:
&ldquo;Will you now be good enough to sing the air for me? I should
like to know if I have sung it right.&rdquo; On one occasion, when
Nachbaur was ill, Ludwig wrote to him: &ldquo;Take care of yourself. Do
it for your family&rsquo;s sake and to preserve your divine voice. Do
it, too, for my sake. I ask it of you, I, the King, who otherwise am
not wont to ask.&rdquo; On another occasion he wrote to him: &ldquo;We
are both opposed to all that is meretricious and bad, and we glow with
holy enthusiasm for everything that is lofty and pure. We will,
therefore, all our lives be faithful and sincere friends.&rdquo; The
singer Vogel, likewise, often received commands to wait upon his
Majesty at a certain hour of the night. He had to sing an air to him,
and was thereafter driven back to his home. The King had been a fine
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>rider, and as a young man he had ridden straight
and undaunted on his favourite horse. This horse he now presented to
the opera singer Frau Vogel. Every time she appeared as Brunhilde in
Wagner&rsquo;s <i lang="de">G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i> she rode it
when she made her daring leaps into the flames. During a performance
when Possart and Frau Ramlo exchanged rings, the King sent them two
diamond rings, which they were instructed to wear on the stage and keep
in remembrance of him.</p>
<p class="par">He spared indeed neither gifts nor distinctions in the
case of actors and singers who won his favour. Gold watches and chains,
brilliants, bracelets, brooches were sent to them from the
<i><span class="corr" id="xd21e2509" title=
"Source: Keiserloge">Kaiserloge</span></i> as signs of approval. During
the latter years of his life, however, he showed more reserve in his
intercourse with artists, and also, on the whole, spoke less often with
persons with whom he was not already acquainted.</p>
<p class="par">Towards the painters to whom he gave orders he was
likewise, as a rule, very friendly. With regard to these also, as where
scenic art was concerned, he inexorably demanded that everything must
be reproduced with historical faithfulness. An error of etiquette in a
picture he blamed as severely as if it had been committed in his
presence. Heinrich von Pechmann had been commissioned to paint a
picture representing the <i lang="fr">Lever de Marie de Antoinette</i>.
Although the general effect of the composition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>was
very pleasing, the King returned it with the message that
&ldquo;ladies-in-waiting did not fan themselves, nor did they converse
with the gentlemen of the court in the Queen&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo;
Moreover, he wished to see among those depicted the composer Gluck, who
was at that time attached to the French court. The artist Ille had been
commanded by Ludwig to paint five large pictures with subjects from the
legend of &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; which it was intended should be hung
at Hohenschwangau. &ldquo;The King would be glad to see the
Emperor&rsquo;s carriage altered,&rdquo; wrote Ludwig&rsquo;s secretary
to him on the subject; &ldquo;but he will not, however, make it a
command against your artistic convictions. Unless rendered impossible
by technical difficulties or the text of the poem, the King would also
like to see the morning or evening sun shining upon the Archangel
Michael. Furthermore, I am to ask you to consider whether the
swan&rsquo;s head is not too large, and if its breast, which is resting
on the water, is not too weak? The King has, I may explain, from his
earliest youth been familiar with the appearance of these birds.&rdquo;
Ille made the required alterations, and received a fine diamond ring as
an expression of the King&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig spent many hours daily in the study of
literature, and invariably took books with him on his mountain
excursions. When he travelled, a trunk was filled with a careful
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>selection of works from his favourite authors.
As Crown Prince he had had no opportunity of receiving instruction at a
college or of acquiring information and experience by sojourns in
foreign lands; but by self-study he became at an early age a
well-informed man. He thoroughly studied countless scientific works;
and when he felt himself drawn towards an author he read everything
that writer had produced. Nor was the author&rsquo;s personality and
private life indifferent to him. If the latter was still alive the King
would give orders that information should be procured for him as to his
pecuniary and other conditions; and were he poor, Ludwig would very
often afford him generous assistance in the most unostentatious manner.

<h2 class="main">Private Performances at the Hof Theater at Munich</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Bavarians were in general inclined to forgive
their King&rsquo;s peculiarities. A single weakness, however, they
found it difficult to condone: they did not like his habit of
commanding private performances at the theatre, of which he was the
only witness.</p>
<p class="par">Although Ludwig covered all the expenses, his private
performances at the Hof Theater became so unpopular that his Ministers
felt themselves constrained to make a protest against them. The blame
for this taste was laid upon Wagner, the charge being based on the fact
that the poet-musician had arranged (1865) a concert in the Hof Theater
at which the King had been the sole audience. More probable is it,
however, that his pleasure in them was awakened little by little, as he
was in the habit of driving in from his castles in the mountain
districts to be present at the various dress rehearsals.</p>
<p class="par">From time to time he would cause translations or
adaptations of French plays from Louis XIV.&rsquo;s time to be made and
played for him alone. Later he transferred his attention <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>to
Louis XV.&rsquo;s time. In his latter years he caused several
historical pieces to be produced, of which the subjects were taken from
the legends relating to Hohenschwangau. The first private performance
took place in 1871, the last towards the end of 1885. In the course of
these fourteen seasons he was present at two hundred and ten
performances, of which forty-five were operas.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2537src" href="#xd21e2537" name="xd21e2537src">1</a> Until and
including 1878 there were never given more than twelve private
performances in each season. In 1879 the number rose to twenty, and in
1883 to twenty-five performances. Everything that was played for the
King alone was artistically perfect.</p>
<p class="par">The actress Charlotte Wolther, who played in the last
<i>Narcisz</i> performance of 1885, has written her impressions of that
evening:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His Majesty had ordered that the representation
should begin at twelve o&rsquo;clock at night, she tells us. All that
was to be seen through the peephole was the brightly lighted
proscenium. Absolute <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195"
name="pb195">195</a>]</span>silence reigned; even the workmen wore felt
slippers. At the stroke of twelve a bell was rung; the King was leaving
the Palace. He passed along the corridor to his great box. A new
ringing of the bell announced that he had entered it, and immediately
the curtain rose! The singer became the victim of a nervous trembling,
and required all her presence of mind to perform her part before a
single witness, at such a strange time, and in such romantic
stillness....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Many stories of doubtful veracity were circulated with
regard to these theatre evenings. French, Russian, and American
journalists depicted them in fantastic colours. The American humorist
Mark Twain wrote amusingly of them; and his accounts won general
credence on both sides of the Atlantic! &ldquo;The opera concluded, and
the artists having washed the paint off their faces, they are
frequently ordered to re-dress, and singers and orchestra have to go
through the opera a second time for the King,&rdquo; he writes in one
of his books. &ldquo;There is in the great Hof Theater an apparatus
which, in case of fire, can put the whole stage under water. A violent
storm was represented at one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>of these private performances. The
theatre tempest howled, the thunder rolled. In a loud voice Ludwig
shouted from his box: &lsquo;Good, very good! But I want real rain. Let
the water flow!&rsquo; The scene-shifter ventured to demur,
representing that the decorations, no less than the silk and velvet
curtains, would be destroyed. &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said the King;
&lsquo;do as I bid you!&rsquo; The water poured out over the stage,
over the artificial flowers and houses. The singers were drenched; they
put a bold face on it, and sang away bravely. The King applauded, and
shouted &lsquo;Bravo! More thunder, more lighting!&rsquo; he ordered.
&lsquo;Bad luck to him who dares to leave the stage!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Needless to say, Mark Twain&rsquo;s story was entirely
the creation of his own brain; Ludwig laughed heartily when the
description was read aloud to him. And yet the citizens of Munich were
no less credulous on this point than the American public. They thought,
among other things, that the King wrote his own plays; and they
declared that his private performances raised the taxation of the
country. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">King Ludwig and his Palaces</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ludwig I. sacrificed millions of guldens in order
to beautify his capital with structures in the antique and Renaissance
styles.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig II. inherited his grandfather&rsquo;s love of
building. Writing to his son, King Otto of Greece, at Christmas 1852,
Ludwig I. says: &ldquo;When the Christmas presents were distributed,
Ludwig was given some wooden bricks with which to construct a triumphal
arch. I saw buildings by him which were excellent. I find a striking
likeness between the future Ludwig II. and the politically defunct
Ludwig I.!&rdquo; He was at that time only seven years of age. At
eleven he drew the plan of a hunting-box, which was to be built at
Hintersee, in the vicinity of Berchtesgaden. The lodge was not built;
but both his grandfather and Queen Maria were astonished at his
early-developed gift. This drawing was given a place in his
mother&rsquo;s album.</p>
<p class="par">Until he had completed his eighteenth year Ludwig had
never any money in his hands: a few months after his eighteenth
birthday he became the possessor of a yearly income of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>many
millions of guldens. His riches appeared inexhaustible to him, and he
thought it an easy matter to realise all his dreams.</p>
<p class="par">The summer mansions of Berg and Herzogenstand which he
had inherited from his father, even his favourite place of residence,
Hohenschwangau, no longer satisfied him. It was his intention to build
a new castle in the neighbourhood of the latter, high up on a rocky
site. The foundation-stone of Neuschwanstein was laid in 1869. Of the
various castles built by Ludwig this is the one which is the most
satisfactory in the impression it affords. From whatever side the
spectator sees it, the effect is beautiful and imposing. There is no
trace in it of the insane lavishness, and, on the whole, of the
inartistic conception which is strikingly evident in the palaces of
Linderhof and Chiemsee.</p>
<p class="par">Neuschwanstein is in pure Romanesque style. The interior
is decorated with pictures from German hero legends and songs. They
represent the <i lang="de">Tannh&auml;user</i> and <i>Lohengrin</i>
legends, the <i lang="de">Niebelungenlied</i> and <i>Parsifal</i>, and
are conceived and executed in an artistic spirit. After the conclusion
of the Franco-German war, building became the thought in Ludwig&rsquo;s
mind round which all others revolved. He occupied himself with the
smallest details in the construction of his castles, and gave exact
descriptions as to how the different apartments were to be decorated.
He procured, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199"
name="pb199">199</a>]</span>much trouble from foreign countries, copies
of objects of art which were inaccessible to others. King Maximilian
had a hunting-box in the vicinity of Ober-Ammergau; here his son built
the fantastic fairy ch&acirc;teau of Linderhof, himself drawing the
plans and carefully studying works on the various styles of
architecture. During the building he continually had new ideas, and was
seized with a desire to change parts of the building. Despite his sure
eye for general effects, he had no idea as to the manner in which the
building should be executed. In order to ascertain how the mansion
would look when complete, he caused walls to be built and resorted to
other radical expedients, which necessitated a considerable increase of
expenditure and eventually led to his financial ruin. The
foundation-stone of Linderhof was laid in 1869. It was not till ten
years later that it approached completion. The mansion is not large,
nor does it give the impression of being in any particular style. It
contains ten reception-rooms of different sizes and shapes, in which
there are collected a multitude of objects, oil paintings and pastel
drawings. The furniture is partly of rosewood. The richly-carved doors
and walls are gilded. On gilded consoles stand Japanese and Chinese
porcelain, majolica, and works in bronze, as well as some magnificent
old Dresden china. The silver-gilt domestic utensils are studded with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>precious stones. The material with which the
furniture is upholstered, the curtains and <i>porti&egrave;res</i>, are
all of heavy velvet and silk with gold embroideries. In the big
drawing-rooms the chandeliers and candelabra are of massive gold. This
magnificence is reflected by several hundred large mirrors.</p>
<p class="par">The building is surrounded by gardens and terraces.
Busts and statues of Greek gods stand on high pillars among the trees
in the shrubberies. In Ludwig&rsquo;s lifetime a fountain threw its
jets of water a hundred and fifty feet into the air. Close by Linderhof
lies &ldquo;The Blue Grotto,&rdquo; a copy of the grotto at Capri, and
the &ldquo;Hunding-H&uuml;tte,&rdquo; which was built at Richard
Wagner&rsquo;s desire. King Maximilian&rsquo;s hunting-lodge was moved,
but an old lime-tree which had stood close by was allowed to retain its
place. A stair led up into the branches of the tree where a
summer-house had been constructed from which there was a fine view of
the surrounding country. When Ludwig was at Linderhof, he spent many
hours of his day in this tree.</p>
<p class="par">As time went on he became absorbed in the art period of
Louis XIV. He built the enormous Schloss Herrenchiemsee, which is a
copy of Versailles and which swallowed many millions of guldens,
although it was never brought to completion. At the time when he drew
the plan of this palace his passion for building <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>was
no longer a fancy which he could tame, but the outcome of a diseased
brain, where the power of will and judgment was impaired. He went,
impelled by his building operations, several journeys to France. His
stay was on each occasion of very short duration; the feverish disquiet
which drove him thither drove him back again almost as quickly. Hardly
a year after the days when Versailles had echoed to the cheers of the
German Princes for the newly elected Emperor, he went, without giving
his Ministers the slightest hint of his intention, in strictest
incognito to Paris. He spent several days at Versailles. The following
year he returned there once more, this time visiting in addition the
town of Rheims, the seat of the coronation of the Kings of France.</p>
<p class="par">Chiemsee, called also &ldquo;the Bavarian sea,&rdquo;
surrounds three islands: Herrenchiemsee, Frauenchiemsee, and the
uninhabited Krautinsel. Herrenchiemsee, or
&ldquo;Herrenw&ouml;rth,&rdquo; was originally a monastery, which at
the time of their suppression went over into private hands. In 1868 it
was in the possession of some business men, who sold it to King Ludwig.
He chose the island as the site of his Versailles. The King&rsquo;s
advisers raised objections, but these only aroused his defiance. He
sent off experts to study the subject, and threw himself heart and soul
into the undertaking. Eight years, however, passed before the plans
were completed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202"
name="pb202">202</a>]</span>Herrenchiemsee consists of an intermediate
building three hundred feet in length, and of two wings surrounding a
quadrangle, the latter being entirely paved with black and white
marble. Everywhere in the palace there are pictures of the Kings and
Queens of France, and the <i>fleurs-de-lys</i> of the Bourbons. The
sixteen living apartments are named after the rooms to which they
answer at Versailles. The finest of these is the mirror gallery, which
is about 250 feet long, 35 feet broad, and 40 feet high. Piercing one
of the walls are 27 lofty arched windows, and on the other a similar
number of large mirrors. Two-and-fifty candelabra of gold and 35
chandeliers provide space for 2500 wax candles.</p>
<p class="par">It was but for few nights that this sea of light burned
in honour of Ludwig II. and his imaginary guests from the time of the
French Kings. From the year 1881 he arrived regularly at Herrenchiemsee
on the 29th of September and remained there till the 8th of October,
inhabiting the first years of this period the so-called royal
apartments in a neighbouring monastery, which could easily have been
changed into an agreeable place of residence had the King had thoughts
for anything but the new palace. He was in the habit of arriving at
midnight. The railway station was near the banks of the lake. A
beautiful gondola, which was used for no other purpose, was waiting to
take him across to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>island; it was rowed by two men in
Neapolitan costume. When the King came he examined everything; on one
occasion, by way of example, he discovered that some groups of statuary
in the park were of plaster instead of marble, as he had ordered, and
he became so angry that he broke them in pieces.</p>
<p class="par">Linderhof, Neuschwanstein, and Herrenchiemsee, on which
he sacrificed so much time and thought, and which caused his financial
ruin, have been later the means of paying his debts. The veil of
mystery which surrounded his person rested likewise as long as he lived
over his residences. But after his death these objects of his pride, so
jealously guarded by him from profane eyes, became accessible to the
public. They are considered, and rightly so, as sights of the first
order. Thousands of visitors yearly, from all countries, admire the
edifices of the splendour-loving King. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h2 class="main">King Ludwig&rsquo;s Friendships</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the time of Ludwig&rsquo;s first visit to
Paris, Cora Pearl, noted alike for her beauty and her frivolity, sent
the young King her portrait. None of his suite dared to present it to
him, it being known that he was not attracted by women. At
Hohenschwangau, a year later, he received his secretary with the
following words:&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen your wife to-day!&rdquo; The
secretary bowed in silence, being uncertain what this utterance might
mean. &ldquo;I have seen your wife to-day!&rdquo; repeated the King in
his severest tone. The secretary now realised the significance of the
words addressed to him, and respectfully assured his Majesty that he
would see that such a thing should not occur again.</p>
<p class="par">The King&rsquo;s dislike of the fair sex could not
otherwise than cause it to be hinted that his emotional life was not
normal, a rumour strengthened by the warm interest which he exhibited
in several men. The Hungarian writer, Maurus J&oacute;kai, has related
in private circles how in his youth he received a letter from an
unknown person offering him riches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>and marks of honour,
everything which a powerful master is in a position to offer, if he
would leave his country and his family and live entirely for an unhappy
and lonely man. The novelist would not break the ties which bound him
to his home and his native land; but he ever retained a deep feeling of
sympathy for the writer of the letter.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig&rsquo;s need for solitude was, without doubt, the
result of enigmatical depths in his nature. As a youth he had
suspected, and as a man of riper years he felt, that it was impossible
for him to be otherwise than a recluse and a stranger in life. Despite
his high position, despite his beauty and gifts of mind, he was in his
inward self helpless and tired of existence. His friendship for Richard
Wagner was the bright spot in his life. He had believed in the incense
with which the master in the first hours of sincere gratitude had
surrounded his protector. But Wagner&rsquo;s proud affection was
something very different from the flattery which met him from courtiers
and his later favourites, who crawled in the dust to promote their own
welfare. His favour and affection came as unexpectedly on the recipient
as his distaste and contempt for them&mdash;his feelings, which found
an outlet in autograph letters, exaggerated expressions, and gifts, not
continuing for any length of time.</p>
<p class="par">At the outbreak of the Franco-German war he was hardly
five and twenty years of age. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206"
href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>It was at this time that his
abnormal mental condition began to be remarked; but prior to this there
had been signs which pointed in the same direction. He had from
childhood been particularly attracted by good-looking faces. On his
accession he pensioned off his father&rsquo;s old servants, and
surrounded himself exclusively with young and handsome men. One of his
grooms, Joseph V&ouml;lkl, was during the years 1864 and 1865 the
holder of a much-envied position at court, accompanying the King on his
journeys to Switzerland and being allowed to sit in the same carriage
with his Majesty. By degrees, however, V&ouml;lkl grew arrogant, and
spoke of his master without respect. Ludwig came to know of this fact,
and degraded him instantly. The former continued, however, to spread
unseemly gossip about, and the matter coming to the ears of the
Ministry, he was dismissed, and died in great poverty.</p>
<p class="par">The Master of the Horse, Hornig, was later the
King&rsquo;s favourite. He was a handsome and well-informed man, with
agreeable manners. During the long period of eighteen years he acted as
Ludwig&rsquo;s private secretary, and accompanied him on his travels.
While Hornig was preparing the details of the journey to Bayreuth, the
King was seized with a sudden unwillingness to undertake it, despite
the fact that he was the official patron of the festival. He discussed
the matter constantly with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"
href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>Master of the Horse, without,
however, being able to make up his mind. The latter was of opinion that
it would create unpleasant remark if the King sent a sudden refusal to
be present. In the heat of conversation he exclaimed: &ldquo;Your
Majesty! it would make us laughable if we did such a thing!&rdquo;
Ludwig was so much annoyed at this &ldquo;us&rdquo; and
&ldquo;we,&rdquo; that Hornig lost his favour from that day. After his
dismissal the royal quartermaster-sergeant, Hesselschwerdt, took his
place. In spite of a poor education he performed his duties to the
King&rsquo;s satisfaction, amusing him, and often disarming his
violence by gross untruths, which Ludwig forgave, although he was not
deceived by them. He remained in the King&rsquo;s service until the end
of his reign.</p>
<p class="par">With the exception of Richard Wagner all the
King&rsquo;s so-called friends suffered from his caprices. The secluded
life he led gave him the time in which to brood over every little
utterance which had displeased him. His rancour was, as a rule, deep,
and his grudges lasting. The two last cabinet secretaries, Dr von
Ziegler and Dr von M&uuml;ller, were both for a time his pronounced
favourites. Even in his last years he understood how to fascinate
others, and was able to master and hide his mental sufferings. Ziegler,
who was possessed of a jovial and happy disposition, had a good
influence on him; and he spoke with admiration and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>respect of Ludwig&rsquo;s nobility of mind. The
secretary&rsquo;s retirement in 1883 was greatly regretted.</p>
<p class="par">From this day forward Ludwig associated almost
exclusively with his domestics. Even his equerries and the secretary
were but occasionally received by their master. Several years before
his death one of his warmest admirers, the Chamberlain von Unger, said
of him: &ldquo;The man who ceases to associate with educated women
becomes coarse; but when, in addition, he avoids association with
educated men, he is wholly and entirely lost!&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Actor Kainz</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Joseph Kainz, the actor, who was later so
celebrated, had, at the beginning of the eighties, an engagement at
Munich; he was then twenty-three years of age. The King saw him for the
first time in Victor Hugo&rsquo;s <i>Marion de Lorme</i>, in which he
played the part of the homeless Didier. His unusually sonorous voice,
his lofty glance, and the passionate warmth of his acting captivated
Ludwig, who the same evening caused to be delivered to him a valuable
sapphire ring. Kainz thanked him in a letter full of fire. In an
autograph letter, dated the 1st of May, 1881, his Majesty assured him
of his friendly feelings, and of his sincere and hearty wishes for his
welfare. He added: &ldquo;Continue as you have begun, in your arduous
and difficult but beautiful and honourable calling.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2744src" href="#xd21e2744" name=
"xd21e2744src">1</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Marion de Lorme</i> was repeated as a separate
performance on the 4th and the 10th of May, and on each occasion Kainz
received a new present from the King. Wishing to know him personally
Ludwig summoned him to Schloss <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210"
href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>Linderhof, where he received
him with charming affability. He kept him with him for two whole weeks,
making excursions with him and treating him as a friend. During the
first meeting the actor had been somewhat reserved and formal; but
after they had been a few days together all shyness departed from his
side, and Ludwig even permitted him to address him as <i>du</i>. The
actor declaimed alternately to and with his Majesty, and their artistic
entertainments lasted till late into the night. Kainz was allowed to be
present at the private performances. The King undertook to provide for
his further education, and corresponded frequently with him. The
friendship between the prince and the actor was much talked about and
much criticised. &ldquo;It depresses me greatly when I see that my
innocent fancies are trumpeted out before the whole world, and are
hatefully criticised,&rdquo; said Ludwig to his new friend. &ldquo;It
has caused me many sad hours. I cannot imagine why I should be grudged
my small pleasures, for they do not harm anybody.&rdquo; When on
another occasion they were discussing the art of acting, he said:
&ldquo;I guard my ideals anxiously. I do not care to notice small
weaknesses, for I do not like the general harmony to be
disturbed.&rdquo; He continued reflectively: &ldquo;It is the same with
regard to actors; I see only the person in the interpreter! The actor
who plays a noble part I imagine to be a noble <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>person.&rdquo; Kainz demurred to this, saying
that although he did not consider himself a villain, it was his wish to
play the part of Franz Moor. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; exclaimed the King
eagerly; &ldquo;you must never represent such a hateful
character.&rdquo; He went on to speak of the part of Didier.
&ldquo;When <i>Marion de Lorme</i> was repeated,&rdquo; said he,
reproachfully, you wore my sapphire ring in the first act. How could
the poor, homeless Didier possess such a costly ornament? It offends
against the laws of truth.&rdquo; Kainz excused himself on the plea
that he had been informed that his Majesty liked his gifts to be
honoured, and that it was for this reason he had worn the ring.</p>
<p class="par">The presents which Kainz received from the King were
particularly valuable, and none of the parts he played went unrewarded.
One evening as he was about to take his departure, having already one
foot in the carriage, Ludwig took his studs from his cuffs and handed
them to him as a parting gift. He had his own room allotted to him at
Linderhof, and he was permitted to drive alone with his royal friend.
The marks of favour which were so abundantly showered upon the young
hero of the theatre proved to be too much for him, and he became very
injudicious. At first Ludwig looked upon his brutality as the outcome
of his love for truth. &ldquo;How good it is to hear the unvarnished
truth!&rdquo; he said to Councillor B&uuml;rckel. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>latter, who knew the new favourite better,
answered shortly: &ldquo;Your Majesty! truth and impertinence are two
different things!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The King desired to make a journey to Spain in company
with the actor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2767src" href="#xd21e2767"
name="xd21e2767src">2</a> but was obliged to abandon the plan because
B&uuml;rckel, who had the arrangement of the trip, represented to him
that the time of year was unfavourable. &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;I have a far greater desire to see Spain than Italy,
which has no attractions for me. But now when I am about to satisfy my
longing, B&uuml;rckel comes with his objections; the propriety of which
I cannot but acknowledge.&rdquo; &ldquo;B&uuml;rckel, however, is only
an adviser,&rdquo; observed Kainz; &ldquo;your Majesty is lord and
master!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Ludwig, &ldquo;but it is not
always so easy to be King as it appears to be.&rdquo; &ldquo;If it is
difficult to your Majesty you can give up the sceptre into other
hands,&rdquo; remarked the actor. The answer displeased the King, who
rose to his feet, thus giving the actor a hint that he must be more
careful in the use of his expressions.</p>
<p class="par">The recollection of earlier visits to Switzerland
entered his mind; he was taken with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>desire to see again
that idyllic land, and the places associated according to tradition
with William Tell. On the 25th of June he wrote to Kainz:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Your dear letter, by which I see how much
you are looking forward to our journey to Switzerland, has given me
great pleasure. It increases very considerably my own delight at the
days I hope to enjoy with you in that beautiful country. The nearer the
time approaches the more exercised does the good B&uuml;rckel seem to
become. He bombards me with the most extraordinary announcements and
suggestions, proposing now that I should take a noble
gentleman-in-waiting with me. If it is not possible for us to do
without such a person, which, however, cannot possibly be the case, I
would rather give up the whole journey. It is necessary to avoid the
stream of tourists there, and their tactless obtrusiveness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is to be hoped that we can get a habitable

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h2 class="main">A Journey to Switzerland</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In order to avoid remark, Ludwig had decided that
his special train should pick him up at ten o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, on the 27th of June, at the station of M&uuml;hlthal, near
Starnberg. He intended to travel as the Marquis de Saverny; Kainz was
to go with him as his friend Didier.</p>
<p class="par">According to the orders which he had received, and at
the appointed hour, the actor duly made his appearance at the little
railway station. The country lay in deep stillness as the royal train,
without a signal or the ringing of a bell, glided up to the platform.
Immediately afterwards the King&rsquo;s spirited team dashed up. Ludwig
jumped out of his equipage and stepped into the railway carriage,
which, besides a sleeping compartment, contained a saloon in which were
easy-chairs, sofas, and a table laid for supper. The train moved off
into the darkness of the night as silently as it had come.</p>
<p class="par">One of the King&rsquo;s stewards, a native of
Switzerland, had gone on in advance to engage a suite of rooms at the
Grand Hotel at Axenstein, near Brunnen. Unfortunately, the King&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>arrival in Switzerland became known. People
hurried from all directions to catch a glimpse of the
&ldquo;romanticist on the throne.&rdquo; When he approached Brunnen on
board the steamer <i>Italia</i>, the banks were covered with
spectators. Ludwig was incapable of repressing his displeasure, which
increased the more when he discovered that all the houses along the
banks of the lake were decorated with flags in his honour. &ldquo;It is
swarming with people here. I wish to live unknown and alone for
myself!&rdquo; he exclaimed. At the landing-stage the hotel carriage
was standing with four horses harnessed to it; and some members of the
Swiss police were also discovered to be drawn up for his reception.
This was too much for the shy Monarch. &ldquo;I will certainly not go
ashore here,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will not make myself a sacrifice
to ovations.&rdquo; He let the steamer go on to Fl&uuml;elen. On the
return trip he made inquiries as to whether there were not some other
locality than Brunnen where he might be put ashore. The captain
mentioned a little place in the neighbourhood, and shaped a course for
it. Hardly was this discovered at Brunnen than the whole mass of people
set off towards it. The landing-stage was thickly covered with a crowd
which received him with marks of delight. Handkerchiefs were waved, and
shouts of hurrah filled the air as his majestic form strode through the
ranks. He answered the greetings of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>people with
affability. &ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; he said, after he was seated
in the carriage, &ldquo;that after all, this warm welcome has given me
pleasure, for it shows well the mind of these good people.<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2810" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> He was
deeply touched by the magnificent scenery, and his face beamed; but
hardly had he noticed the numbers of strangers who continued to press
round his carriage than he began to lose heart again.</p>
<p class="par">He walked up and down in his rooms at the hotel, saying
again and again: &ldquo;This is a hotel and not a castle; I will not
remain here!&rdquo; A few days later he took the villa
&ldquo;Guttenberg,&rdquo; whence he made many excursions in the
neighbourhood. The cantonal government placed a steamer at his
disposal, and this he very often used. Kainz recited to him in the
beautiful moonlight nights, and from the banks of the lake of Lucerne
he heard the joyous Swiss peasant songs. His friendly manner won much
sympathy in the neighbourhood. One Sunday seven pretty young Swiss
girls announced themselves at his villa; they had come to ask him for
money in order to go to America. As he was not at home one of them
requested some writing materials, after which, in a bright and original
manner, she penned the wishes of herself and her friends. The letter
was laid before the King, who was greatly amused at it. He answered,
however, that he loved and honoured the Swiss people <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>far
too well for him to be a party to the leaving of it of seven of its
most charming daughters.</p>
<p class="par">It is said that the Swiss people gave utterance to the
following sentiment: &ldquo;If we had to elect a king for ourselves,
our choice could not fall on any other than Ludwig II. of
Bavaria.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He had a great affection for and visited often the
beautiful R&uuml;tli, the spot where the ancient Swiss took their oath
of allegiance. Kainz accompanied him thither, and they spent hours
together at the view, where the young actor would recite the R&uuml;tli
song:</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Sei, R&uuml;tli, mir freundlich
gegr&uuml;sset,</p>
<p class="line">Du stilles Gel&auml;nde am See,</p>
<p class="line">Wo spielend die Welle zerfliesset,</p>
<p class="line">Gen&auml;hrt vom ewigen Schnee!</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Da standen die V&auml;ter zusammen</p>
<p class="line">F&uuml;r Freiheit und heimisches Gut</p>
<p class="line">Und schwuren beim heiligsten Namen,</p>
<p class="line">Zu st&uuml;rzen die Zwingherrenbrut!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">They went almost every evening to a neighbouring
inn where they partook of a meal, the King being exceedingly modest in
his demands, and not even requiring dinner-napkins or a tablecloth. He
was in the habit of talking much to the landlord, whom he liked to give
him information as to the mode of life of the Swiss peasantry.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The King&rsquo;s relations with Kainz became somewhat
cooler on the former&rsquo;s side towards the end of their stay in
Switzerland. One evening at R&uuml;tli Ludwig asked him to recite
something from Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Wilhelm Tell</i>. The actor was
willing to do this, but put it off till later. At two in the morning
Ludwig repeated his request, when Kainz replied that he was too tired
to recite anything. Ludwig looked at him a moment in astonishment and
was silent. At last he said: &ldquo;Oh, you are tired, are you? Rest,
then!&rdquo; and turning on his heel walked away.</p>
<p class="par">Hesselschwerdt and the landlord went with him to the
steamer. When they were on board the landlord said: &ldquo;Herr
Marquis, Herr Didier has not yet come!&rdquo; &ldquo;Let him
rest,&rdquo; answered Ludwig; &ldquo;we will go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Kainz had himself rowed across to Brunnen, but the King
had left when he arrived there. The actor followed him to Lucerne, and
prayed Hesselschwerdt to announce him to the King. The former returned
and said that his Majesty would receive him in the garden, if he did
not wish to make up for his lost night&rsquo;s rest. Ludwig appeared
shortly afterwards. Kainz made several excuses, which the King
interrupted, assuring him that he was glad to see him again, and that
he regretted his own want of spirits. Although Ludwig treated him with
familiarity, his extreme sense of self-esteem could not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>endure that a seemly line of demarcation should
be passed by his young friend.</p>
<p class="par">After the return from Switzerland he did not invite him
again; nor did he ever again witness any performance of his on the
stage, but for a short space of time he continued to carry on a
correspondence with the actor. His last letter, in which he thanks
Kainz for good wishes which the latter had sent him, concludes with the
following words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Probably Didier sometimes thinks kindly of
his Saverny. My hearty greetings to you. All good spirits bless you.
This is wished you with all his heart by your friendly,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ludwig</span>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Swiss ch&acirc;let at Hohenschwangau, the
31st July, 1881, at night.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Shortly afterwards Kainz was dismissed from the Hof
Theater at Munich. As long as the King lived he hoped to be recalled;
but the hope was not destined to be fulfilled. When, later, Ludwig
heard him spoken of he would abruptly change the topic of conversation;
and when he read his name in the newspaper would lay the latter aside,
or throw it into the waste-paper basket.</p>
<p class="par">Kainz&rsquo;s conduct proved that he had been unworthy
of his friendship; nobody perhaps abused his confidence more than he
did. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>King had hardly drawn his last breath before the
young actor sold all his letters to a Berlin newspaper. Ludwig had in
these letters allowed him to glance into his inward life, and their
publication immediately after the benefactor&rsquo;s death was not only
unseemly but heartless. The general opinion of his conduct is expressed
in the following verse:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Hat Ludwig dir in k&ouml;niglicher

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">King Ludwig and his Servants</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The friend of Ludwig&rsquo;s childhood, Count
Holnstein, had made himself well-nigh indispensable at the Bavarian
court; and in order further to increase his power he had filled the
situations of personal attendance on the King with soldiers of light
horse belonging to his own regiment. This system was abetted by the
Master of the Horse, Hornig. The greater number of the grooms engaged
by him knew nothing of the formalities demanded by a court, even though
that court was a recluse&rsquo;s and the King an eccentric. Before they
entered on their duties they were accordingly instructed in deportment
by the royal ballet-master, and taught propriety of speech and
elocution by the court actors.</p>
<p class="par">These inexperienced soldiers were now set to wait upon a
selfish and exacting Monarch, to serve him at meals in proper fashion,
and to assist him at his toilet, although they hardly knew the names of
the articles in his daily use. Their helplessness, which is easily to
be understood, called forth violent outbreaks of temper on the
King&rsquo;s side, and several times he allowed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>himself to be so carried away that he lay hands
on them. Upon occasion he struck them with his riding-whip, and it is
said that he once emptied his teapot over the back of one of his
lacqueys. He had an unreasoning dislike of plain faces. One of his
father&rsquo;s confidential servants displeased him so much in his
childhood by his unattractive appearance that he always turned away
when the man entered the room, although he knew that his action caused
Maximilian great annoyance. Nevertheless his personal footman, Mayr,
who managed to stay with him longer than any other servant, had an
exterior which was extremely displeasing to him. His face alarmed him;
and he ordered for long periods at a time that he should appear before
him in a mask when waiting upon him at meals. Ludwig could not endure
this man, and often said that he had a premonition that Mayr would
bring him bad luck. Nevertheless he could not do without him, the
lacquey understanding well how to please his master. On the forehead of
another footman, who was often guilty of one or other piece of
clumsiness, the King placed a seal of wax, and he was forbidden to
enter the presence without this sign of his stupidity.</p>
<p class="par">Although Ludwig&rsquo;s servants suffered from his
irritable temper, he was at other times a far too lenient master,
heaping his subordinates with presents and marks of favour when he felt
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>he had done them an injustice; and when he found
it necessary to send one away always providing for his future. One of
his personal attendants became seriously ill. Ludwig visited him and
found his home without any of the conveniences of life. He asked him
why he did not move to a better and more healthy place. The sick man
answered that his means would not allow of it. The same day he sent him
a present of a considerable sum of money, and later raised his
wages.</p>
<p class="par">Every year, on Twelfth Night, he was in the habit of
giving a servant&rsquo;s ball at his hunting-box, Pleckenau. It has
been said that each of these festivities cost him 40,000 marks,
although the gifts he had distributed did not consist of anything of
greater value than eatables and beverages. All classes of his servants
were his guests; the whole day was spent in festivity. The King amused
himself by looking on at their enjoyment; and it is said sometimes took
part in their amusements. This, as well as several other assertions
regarding his private life, are an exaggeration and not in conformity
with the truth. An incredible spirit of indifference reigned in the
household; his subordinates abused his kindness and enriched themselves
in a simply astounding manner. One of his servants, when in a state of
intoxication, shot a workman; the care of the latter in the castle was
paid for out of Ludwig&rsquo;s purse, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>although the
occurrence was hid from his Majesty, it being known that otherwise he
would certainly have dismissed and punished his servant. While the
&ldquo;Most Gracious&rdquo; was living in his world of dreams, taking
heed for nothing, his servants amused themselves the livelong
night.</p>
<p class="par">The King refused all permission to see over his castles.
This proscription, however, was not respected, and without his
knowledge relations and friends were continually shown round. Even
those who had no connection with the household had only to express a
wish, and the servants at once acted against their master&rsquo;s
orders. If he heard the noise made by these strangers, those about him
understood how to convince him that he was mistaken; and did he remark
strange faces, received for answer that his nearsightedness had
deceived him.</p>
<p class="par">He became at last so weary of his surroundings that he
gave his orders through closed doors; a scratching at the wall denoted
that these orders had been understood. The few of his subordinates who
were permitted to enter his presence had to stand bowing low, and
refrain from looking at the King. Or again, he would give his orders in
writing. He commanded that these papers should be immediately torn up;
but his servants nevertheless preserved every line from his hand, and
made use of them in due course as weapons against him. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Mad King</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the most beautiful of the castles built by
Ludwig II. there stands near the entrance to the fine concert-room a
curious piece of statuary, for the execution of which he himself
provided the idea: a palm in the prime of its abundance and strength,
laden with golden fruit. At the foot of it is represented a loathsome
dragon, with wide-open mouth&mdash;a symbol of the inherited malady
which was lying in wait for the heavily oppressed Monarch.</p>
<p class="par">In the case of Prince Otto of Bavaria madness had broken
out suddenly: in the case of Ludwig it came unnoticed and insidiously,
not even the specialists being quite alive to the danger. There can be
no doubt that he himself knew that he was periodically insane; but he
was determined at any cost to prevent the outside world from seeing him
in this condition.</p>
<p class="par">In February 1884 he caused a dentist to be summoned to
him. The latter has written down his reminiscences from his visit. The
King was exceedingly gracious. He spoke first of the suffering caused
him by his teeth. Although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>he could not bear his servants to
look at him he endured this strange dentist for hours, without a look
or a word betraying the dislike he must undoubtedly have felt of his
presence. When the dentist contradicted him a couple of times he took
it with calmness and good-humour. He adduced new reasons for his
opinions, and showed admirable self-possession.</p>
<p class="par">With his whole strength he fought to free himself from
the fatal web which was being spun closer and closer around him. He
sought to keep himself in balance by restless activity, building
castles in three different localities. Many of the objects which filled
his residences were constructed after his own designs, and he tested
them carefully and selected the places where they were to stand.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig was particularly interested in French literature,
and was seized with a violent admiration for the court of Versailles.
Louis XIV. became his ideal. At first he contented himself with copying
his buildings. Later he endeavoured to imitate his gait, his carriage,
and his daily habits. He surrounded himself with pictures of him and
his court; he wore cuff-studs on which were <i>fleurs-de-lys</i>, and
the same emblem was embroidered in gold on chairs, sofas, and cushions
in his apartments. He longed to be an absolute autocrat; and the
countless books and writings which he perused treating of Louis XIV.
provided his distorted imagination <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227"
href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>with continual food. During
the latter years of his life he was completely under the sway of
megalomania, thinking that he was receiving visits from and conversing
with <i lang="fr">le Roi Soleil</i>. At times he was even under the
hallucination that he was that powerful autocrat.</p>
<p class="par">For Marie Antoinette also he cherished a morbid
admiration, losing himself in dreams about that unhappy Queen, and
causing Masses to be said on the day of her and Louis XVI.&rsquo;s
execution. Round the table in the great dining-hall chairs were placed
for the ladies and gentlemen of the French court. At times he believed
that they really sat there, and conversed animatedly with them in
French. Apt as he often could be in his remarks, he was heard to
observe that this society was so agreeable to him because &ldquo;they
came when they were wanted and disappeared at the first
hint.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Always solitary, he gave himself up almost entirely to
his fantastic whims. When he did not drive out he would spend the night
on the lake, or in the brightly-illuminated concert-room of his castle.
For some years he cherished a mad scheme of employing a number of
detectives to make the round of his kingdom and listen to all they
could hear about his person.</p>
<p class="par">His was a curious double nature: to his great sympathy
for the republic of Switzerland and the hero of freedom, William Tell,
he united <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>the wish for a Bastille, where every person who
dared to express a different opinion from his own might be incarcerated
for life.</p>
<p class="par">The lattices and walls with which he surrounded his
castles show better than all rumour how he avoided his fellow-men. To a
learned scientist was allotted the task of finding a desert island or
distant land which might be exchanged for Bavaria, and where the
absolutist state which he dreamt of might be established. Although he
had such a high opinion of his royal dignity, he forgot it on a
thousand occasions; and so much was this the case that at his last
court reception in Munich his mother found herself constrained to bring
the gathering to an end.</p>
<p class="par">His outbreaks of violence became more frequent; his
struggles against the disease weaker. At times everything seemed
indifferent to him. At others he heard steps behind him and turned
round in fear; but no one was to be seen. He saw reptiles crawling on
the floor, but discovered the next moment that the lacquey who
obediently stooped to pick the animal up had nothing in his hand. He
would endeavour to trick the servant by demanding that he should see
things which he himself did not see, and would fall upon him in anger
and contempt when he had allowed himself to be betrayed into these
subterfuges. When Ludwig drove out he was in the habit of bowing deeply
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>to a particular tree in the wood; and clad in
his coronation robes, with his sceptre in his hand, he would also bow
respectfully to the statues of the French kings. Several times he
caused the snow to be covered with stones, so that in winter he might
imagine it to be summer.</p>
<p class="par">But despite all he retained his power of acute
observation. He never ceased to a certain degree to think logically and
to pursue steadily any act or design. Even during the last years of his
life there were days and weeks when he was in full possession of his
mental powers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Last Meeting between Mother and Son</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">During one of the last winters of his life Ludwig
unexpectedly invited his mother to visit him at Neuschwanstein.</p>
<p class="par">For the first two days he fell in with her habits,
driving out with her and keeping her company in the evenings. But he
soon returned to his usual mode of life. When he said good-night to her
he would go for his long solitary drive; and he slept till late in the
forenoon as his habit was.</p>
<p class="par">Unluckily this also happened on the day when the
Queen-mother was to take her departure. Ludwig had not returned from
his drive until the morning hours, and he had not given orders that he
should be awakened. His mother&rsquo;s carriage, with the horses
harnessed to it, stood waiting for over an hour in the courtyard of the
castle, while she herself paced up and down the great hall. Her nervous
impatience went over to a fit of anger when he eventually showed
himself, and broke like a thunderstorm over the head of her son. An
eye-witness has related that she scolded him as if he were still the
little Ludwig who used <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>to hold fast to her skirts. What
was still worse was that she scolded him in the hearing of all his
footmen.</p>
<p class="par">The King kissed his excited mother repeatedly on the
hand, begging her to excuse his tardiness. He conducted her
respectfully to her carriage, took his seat beside her, and drove with
her to the railway station. The mood he was in upon his return
indicated the deep resentment he felt at her corrections. This was the
last time she visited him; but upon one later occasion he paid her a
visit.</p>
<p class="par">The Queen-mother resided for the greater part of the
year at Elbingen-Alp, a house more resembling that of a peasant than a
royal residence. Reports of her son&rsquo;s unaccountable conduct
penetrated frequently to her; and what she suffered during these bitter
years may well be imagined. On the 5th of October, 1885, she was
residing at Hohenschwangau, the King being then at Linderhof. It was
her sixtieth birthday, and Ludwig was seized with the idea of
congratulating her on it in person. At about ten in the evening he
arrived at Hohenschwangau. The gates of the castle were locked; on the
demand of the porter as to who was without, answer was made that the
King desired to speak with his mother. The Queen-mother was in course
of preparing to retire; her son&rsquo;s unexpected appearance brought
the whole <i>personnel</i> of the establishment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>into
commotion. He remained the night at the castle, and dined with Queen
Marie and her ladies at Pleckenau the following day.</p>
<p class="par">He was now completely incapable, from want of habit, of
carrying on a society conversation. During the whole course of the
dinner he did not speak a word to anyone but his mother, and was far
more silent than heretofore. His intercourse with the Queen-mother was
this time stamped by the greatest affection. After dinner he drove back
to Linderhof, his mother accompanying him half way; it was the last
bright spot in her life. At the defile, where seven months later the
peasantry assembled to liberate their captured King, the mother and son
took leave of one another, never to meet again. Half-a-year later the
Emperor of Austria earnestly begged Queen Marie to visit Ludwig, and
endeavour to induce him to show himself before the world, as alarming
rumours were in circulation as to his mental condition. The harassed
mother addressed herself in writing to her son, who replied that he
would receive her Majesty in three days&rsquo; time. The period for her
departure was fixed, and her equipages and servants despatched to
Hohenschwangau; but the latter were informed on their arrival by
Ludwig&rsquo;s stablemen that they might go back again. &ldquo;The
Queen will not be admitted to the King,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;he is
unapproachable to everybody.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Shortly afterwards a telegram was despatched in which it
was said that the King greatly regretted that he was prevented by
toothache from receiving anybody, and therefore his dear mother
likewise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Pecuniary Distress</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Bavaria was distressed and saddened in the spring
of 1886. No personal lecture took place any longer before the King. All
affairs of state were conducted in writing, and all Ludwig&rsquo;s
commands were transmitted through his functionary, Hesselschwerdt.</p>
<p class="par">Those who were in a position to know had long been aware
that his financial situation must be improved if the prestige of the
crown were not to suffer thereby. The newspapers announced that his
health was in a less satisfactory state. He himself endeavoured to
disarm these assertions by taking walks in the middle of the day, and
speaking graciously with those whom he might meet on his way. He had
never known the value of money, but regarded it as the Ministers&rsquo;
duty to procure it, and as his own right to dissipate it. In 1884 his
Minister of Finance, Dr von Riedel, had negotiated a loan of 7,500,000
marks. Hardly a year afterwards the same Minister received an autograph
letter in which he was desired to raise a new loan of 6,500,000 marks.
He now explained without circumlocution to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>King
in what a critical situation the privy purse found itself. The
information aroused disquiet in Ludwig; despite which, however, he
showed himself deaf to the representations which were made to him.
Through a court functionary, in a subordinate position, he corrected
the Minister because he had ventured to address himself directly to his
Majesty. Riedel made answer by tendering his resignation. The rest of
the Ministry declared that if it was accepted they would all resign.
The other members of the Council of State also received a reprimand at
this time. Simultaneously, however, Ludwig despatched to his Minister
of Finance a gracious letter, in which he requested him to remain in
office.</p>
<p class="par">It is quite clear that his debts were not the
consequence of unwise financial operations; nor were they the immediate
consequence of his passing caprices. The deficit in the exchequer was
owing in the main to his insatiable passion for building. The
completion of his palaces was delayed on account of financial
difficulties. Nevertheless, he occupied himself continually with plans
for the future; a new castle, to be called &ldquo;Falkenstein,&rdquo;
was to be erected on an all but inaccessible mountain-top close to the
borders of the Tyrol. Another, smaller, castle was to be built in
Chinese style in the neighbourhood of Linderhof.</p>
<p class="par">The debts augmented from day to day. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>Business people who required their money waited
with impatience for their bills to be paid. Several creditors sent in
legal complaint to a collective amount of a million and a half. A
catastrophe seemed inevitable; it was said out loud that it was time to
put a stop to the King&rsquo;s building enterprises.</p>
<p class="par">Although Ludwig no longer received his secretary, the
machinery of legislation still went its accustomed way. He signed the
documents which were sent to him; but even important papers of state
only reached him through the intervention of domestics, and if he
happened to be in an ill-humour they lay scattered about on his table
for days.</p>
<p class="par">His want of money was known far outside the limits of
his kingdom. Ludwig was angered at the contemptuous manner in which the
financial newspapers of Vienna and Berlin made mention of it; and it
was a painful surprise to him to find that the Jews were those who
attacked him the most mercilessly. &ldquo;Do they not know,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;that I am the only prince who from the beginning of
the anti-Semitic movement has taken strong measures to counteract
it?&rdquo; His pressing need for money rendered him apt to regard every
unknown person as a dun. &ldquo;Yesterday when I was driving,&rdquo; he
said to his barber, &ldquo;I met a man who looked at me in such a
curious manner that I positively thought he had come to seize
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>my horses.&rdquo; On one of his last walks in
the woods of Neuschwanstein he met a poor boy who was gathering
faggots. When he asked him who his parents were the lad answered that
his father had been a stone-cutter, but was now out of work. &ldquo;Why
does he not ask the King for help?&rdquo; inquired Ludwig. &ldquo;He
has no money himself, and nobody will lend him any,&rdquo; was the
reply. The King laughed, and handed him a five-mark piece; but his
laughter was no doubt bitter.</p>
<p class="par">His debts had reached a sum of 14,000,000 marks. On the
5th of May, 1886, his Ministers represented to him that it was
absolutely necessary that his pecuniary affairs should be brought into
order, and his expenses reduced. Months before this date he had been
informed that every prospect of opening new resources was cut off. He
now set to work himself, in every conceivable manner, to raise money.
Hesselschwerdt was sent to Ratisbon in order if possible, to raise a
loan of 20,000,000 marks from the enormously wealthy Prince of Thurn
and Taxis. Bismarck was consulted; and the King endeavoured to obtain
money from America. An aide-de-camp was despatched to the Emperor of
Brazil, another was sent to the King of Sweden, and a third to the King
of the Belgians. The financial magnates Rothschild, Bleichr&ouml;der,
and Erlanger were requested to give him their support; and he planned
an application to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>the Sultan of Turkey and to the Shah of
Persia. The means of assistance to which he resorted in his need are
clear proofs that his mental and moral powers were rapidly declining;
and in his alarm and confusion he even gave secret orders that persons
should be procured who would be willing to break into the banks of some
of the capitals of Europe.</p>
<p class="par">Two of his cousins were still unconvinced of his
insanity; they were therefore willing to give him their support. They
put him in relations with the House of Orleans, who, during their short
period of rule, had thought more of filling their own pockets than of
the welfare of France. This family addressed themselves to Rothschild
in Paris, who sent his secretary to Munich with the power to conclude a
large loan if the conditions which he required were acknowledged by the
King. The House of Orleans were to be the guarantors of the loan,
which, as a matter of fact, they had already undertaken to be.</p>
<p class="par">Preliminary consultations took place. The final issue
came to nothing, according to report, because on the French side it was
demanded that Ludwig should bind himself to neutrality in the event of
a war between Prussia and France. Rothschild&rsquo;s secretary went
back to Paris, and informed his master that he had suffered defeat. The
King apparently was willing to give a promissory note; in political
respects, on the other hand, he refused to bind himself. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Plots</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The influence of Count von Holnstein at the court
of Bavaria had lasted up to 1883, when he fell into disfavour. The
reason for this is not generally known. It has been said that he
refused his assistance in the matter of a loan; others again have
declared that Ludwig gained cognisance of certain deprecatory
expressions which the Count had made use of with reference to his
master.</p>
<p class="par">It will be clear to everybody who knows how difficult a
matter it is to appoint legal guardians of an individual&rsquo;s person
and fortune, that the step which it was now intended to take must have
been doubly difficult where a reigning monarch was concerned. Though
his personal relations with Ludwig had been strained, Count Holnstein
had remained in his post of Grand Master of the Horse. For a great
number of years he had had exact knowledge of the King&rsquo;s mode of
life, and he was in a position to procure a very large amount of
weighty material by which, if used as proof against Ludwig, it might be
possible to attain the desired end. As the King no longer associated
with others than his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240"
name="pb240">240</a>]</span>servants, there existed only three or four
persons from whom any information could be procured regarding his
immediate past. Holnstein undertook to treat with these persons, and
they proved to be willing to express themselves in the same spirit as
himself.</p>
<p class="par">The attendants on Ludwig&rsquo;s person were Mayr, whose
name has been previously mentioned in these pages, and a former soldier
of light horse, Alfons Weber by name. The latter, however, was kept in
absolute ignorance of the whole matter. Mayr, on the other hand, was in
unbroken intercourse with the leading circles in Munich; and it was he
and Hesselschwerdt, in addition to Count Holnstein, who adduced the
proofs that the time had come to place the King under restraint.</p>
<p class="par">From the first half of the month of May the greater
number of those about him were prepared for an impending catastrophe.
His creditors became more and more importunate, his need for money more
and more pressing. As no prospects of assistance from any direction
could be seen, Ludwig determined to reassume negotiations with
Rothschild. He was now promised a loan of thirty or forty million
francs, at four per cent. interest, to be paid within a certain period
of time. In the event of Bavaria remaining neutral during a possible
war between France and Prussia, repayment of the sum would be remitted,
together with all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241"
name="pb241">241</a>]</span>further interest. In this manner the
agreement was deprived of the sting which might wound the allies in
Germany; and no more was demanded of the King of Bavaria than what, if
necessary, he could subscribe to.</p>
<p class="par">Hesselschwerdt, who had been the former intermediary
between Rothschild&rsquo;s secretary and his master, received orders
from Ludwig to proceed to Paris with a royal note of hand, and to
receive the money-prince&rsquo;s millions. At this juncture Count
Holnstein suddenly stepped forth. As chief of the royal stables he was
Hesselschwerdt&rsquo;s superior. He was aware that Rothschild&rsquo;s
secretary had been in Munich, and knew of the interviews the latter had
had with members of the House of Orleans. In expectation of what might
arise, he had impressed upon Hesselschwerdt that he must not undertake
any task without his, the Count&rsquo;s, knowledge, since King Ludwig,
in the painful position in which he found himself, might possibly allow
himself to be led into taking a step which might have serious
consequences to the state.</p>
<p class="par">When the negotiations were resumed in the month of May,
Holnstein had begun a course of baths at Karlsbad. Before his departure
he had strictly charged Hesselschwerdt immediately to inform him if his
journey to Paris could not be averted. The Count had added
threateningly: &ldquo;Obey me, Hesselschwerdt, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>you
may pay dearly for it!&rdquo; Holnstein had hardly been a week at
Karlsbad before he received the expected telegram. He hastened to
Munich, and summoned Hesselschwerdt to him. The court functionary
brought with him the sealed writing which contained Ludwig&rsquo;s note
of hand.</p>
<p class="par">Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation the Count carried
him off to the Premier, Dr von Lutz, and delivered into the
latter&rsquo;s hands the letter to Rothschild, which was sealed with
the King&rsquo;s signet. This done he sought an audience of Prince
Luitpold, who, on the outbreak of Prince Otto&rsquo;s malady, had
become the person who stood nearest to the throne. While he was
conversing with the King&rsquo;s uncle, it was announced that the
Ministry desired an audience. A council was held. Ludwig&rsquo;s letter
was opened, and Hesselschwerdt was forbidden to undertake the journey
to Paris. Four eminent physicians were summoned. They declared the King
to be insane, and assumed his malady to be incurable.</p>
<p class="par">There was now a plausible excuse for placing him under
restraint.</p>
<p class="par">A secret conference of the princes of the blood-royal
met in Munich. Against two votes it was determined that the
King&rsquo;s person should be placed under restraint and a Regency
proclaimed, with Prince Luitpold as Regent. The Ministry should remain
in office. It was desired to constitute the Grand Master of the Court,
Count <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>von Castell, Ludwig&rsquo;s guardian; but he
refused the melancholy task. Count Holnstein was then appointed to fill
this post. It was Prince Luitpold&rsquo;s desire that the King should
be informed of what had been decided upon before the proclamation took
place, to the effect that he might give his consent to the new order of
affairs.</p>
<p class="par">Dr von Lutz simultaneously informed Prince Bismarck of
the contemplated loan in Paris, and of the fact that members of the
House of Orleans had played a part in the matter. The Prince gave the
then French Premier a hint of their attitude. A debate relating to the
expulsion of the Orleans princes was just at that time on the order of
the day in the French Senate. The terms of Bismarck&rsquo;s telegram
let it be supposed that the princes had desired to make use of
Ludwig&rsquo;s pecuniary difficulties in order to play a political
part.</p>
<p class="par">This information is said to have been the chief reason
for the expulsion of the Orleans family from France. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Preparations to Imprison the King&mdash;The Peasantry
Assemble to his Rescue</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Hesselschwerdt, it need hardly be said, could no
more show himself before the King. He informed his master that he had
been taken ill, and therefore had been unable to proceed to Paris.
Ludwig, however, came to know, through his barber, that his functionary
was walking about the streets of the capital in robust health. Though
prior to this his suspicions had been now and again slightly aroused,
he could never have supposed that the sealed letter which he had
confided to him would have been given into other hands.</p>
<p class="par">A so-called Court Commission was meanwhile on its way to
Hohenschwangau to imprison the King, and place him under medical
treatment. It consisted of the Minister of the Royal House, Count
Crailsheim; Counts Holnstein and T&ouml;rring; Herr von Washington, who
was to be the King&rsquo;s gentleman-in-waiting; and of the director of
the public Asylum for the Insane at Munich, Dr von Gudden. These
gentlemen were furthermore accompanied by an assistant doctor and eight
keepers. Of Ludwig&rsquo;s nearest <i>entourage</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>only
his valet, Weber, and the stablemen had any idea of what was about to
happen.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of the 9th of June a string of royal
carriages drew up before the old castle of Hohenschwangau. Count
Holnstein, who sat in the foremost of them, proceeded at once to the
royal stables to inform the <i>personnel</i> that it was to be
dispersed. The coachman, Osterholzer, was in the act of harnessing the
horses to Ludwig&rsquo;s carriage, for the King, according to his
custom, wished to drive out in the course of the night. The Count
ordered that the horses should be taken out at once, as another
carriage was in readiness, with another coachman to drive it.
Osterholzer pleaded his master&rsquo;s orders. &ldquo;The King has
nothing more to order,&rdquo; answered Holnstein. &ldquo;It is his
Royal Highness, Prince Luitpold, who now reigns.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3077src" href="#xd21e3077" name=
"xd21e3077src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">The coachman understood that there was a plot against
the King. He took the horses back to the stable. As quickly as his legs
could carry him he thereupon ran by a steep woodland path up to
Neuschwanstein, where he informed the valet on duty, Weber, what had
occurred.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig was walking up and down in the brightly lighted
concert hall, declaiming in a loud voice parts of an opera which had
lately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>been dedicated to him. Osterholzer rushed
breathlessly in, throwing himself on his knees before him, and in his
excitement able only to stammer forth some incoherent words. The King
did not understand him; he beckoned Weber to him, and asked what was
the meaning of this scene. The valet explained that Count Holnstein and
some other gentlemen had arrived at Hohenschwangau, and that traitorous
designs on his Majesty were entertained. Osterholzer implored him to
flee at once; Weber, too, offered his assistance. Ludwig refused the
offer. &ldquo;Why should I flee?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If any real
danger threatened me, Karl would have written to me&rdquo;!
&ldquo;Karl&rdquo; was the court functionary Hesselschwerdt, in whom,
even at this moment, he placed his trust.</p>
<p class="par">After some consideration he, nevertheless, gave orders
that his servants should assemble. &ldquo;Run as quickly as
possible,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Call all loyal peasants here to
protect their King!&rdquo; The stablemen and men-servants hurried away,
and raised the alarm in the neighbouring villages. Hardly an hour had
passed before Hohenschwangau was swarming with peasants armed with
knives, and carrying axes and scythes across their shoulders.
F&uuml;ssen, the town nearest to Hohenschwangau, sent her fire-brigade,
and the chief of the police stationed there appeared with all his men.
As nobody had any knowledge of what had occurred in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>Munich, there was every ground to suppose that
an attack on the King&rsquo;s person was intended. All were ready to
risk their life in order to rescue him.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile in the light of dawn the Court Commission had
reached the gates of Neuschwanstein. It had been agreed that one of its
members should read aloud Prince Luitpold&rsquo;s address to the King,
after which the doctors were to convey him to Linderhof. To their
surprise, they found the doors of the castle guarded by gendarmes, who
forbade them in the King&rsquo;s name to enter. They produced their
written authorisation to do this. The gendarme on guard did not deign
to glance at it, but answered all representations and commands with:
&ldquo;I require nothing in writing! I know only one command, and that
comes from his Majesty!&rdquo; The gentlemen now attempted entrance by
force; but the gendarme remained firm to his orders, and threatened to
shoot down every person who should dare to penetrate into the castle.
He raised his gun to his shoulder, as he referred for the last time to
the reigning King&rsquo;s command. Other gendarmes now pressed
forward<span class="corr" id="xd21e3092" title="Not in source">.</span>
A blow from a cudgel struck one of the keepers who was standing near.
&ldquo;Unpleasant as this conduct was,&rdquo; says the assistant
physician, Dr M&uuml;ller, &ldquo;it could not be denied that these men
were behaving loyally when, regardless of the brilliant uniforms
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>of the state officials, they unwaveringly held
firm to: &lsquo;Our King has commanded it, and we obey
him!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Court Commission were compelled to retire to
Hohenschwangau with their mission unaccomplished. The rumour that the
King was to be dragged away a prisoner had meanwhile spread over the
whole countryside. As the Commission drove down to the old castle they
saw peasants, woodcutters, and firemen, women and children, in frantic
haste speeding up towards Neuschwanstein. The sheriff and chief
official of <span class="corr" id="xd21e3099" title=
"Source: Fl&uuml;ssen">F&uuml;ssen</span>, Herr Sonntag, was charged by
Ludwig to arrest the members of the Commission. He appeared at
Hohenschwangau to execute the command. Minister Crailsheim rated him,
and told him that he had no right whatever to act in the manner he was
doing. &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; answered the venerable old man,
&ldquo;I am in a painful dilemma. Not by a word have I been prepared
for that which was to happen, nor have I been advised as to what my
conduct should be with regard to my master. I have served him so many
years, and even at this hour am his official; I cannot in a few minutes
forget the love and loyalty of past years and determine to act as my
King&rsquo;s enemy.&rdquo; He performed the arrests, and sent the
prisoners under a strong escort to Neuschwanstein.</p>
<p class="par">Count Holnstein expressed a desire to drive,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>but no heed was paid to his wish; the gentlemen
had to walk on foot through the raving crowd which had assembled. The
courtyard also was filled to overflowing. Hundreds of men and women
threatened them in loud voices. &ldquo;Look at these men,&rdquo; called
a young woman to her seven-year-old daughter; &ldquo;when you are big
you can say you have seen traitors.&rdquo; Considerable effort was
necessary to prevent the crowd from turning their threats into reality.
The least courage was shown by Dr Gudden. The crowd having heard that
it was he who had declared the King to be mad rushed upon him, and
threatened to throw him in the neighbouring falls of the
P&ouml;llat.</p>
<p class="par">A terrible hatred had shone in Ludwig&rsquo;s eyes when
he was told that the friend of his childhood, Count Holnstein, was
among the traitors. He had commanded that all the members of the
Commission should be thrown into a dungeon. This, however, was not
done; they were imprisoned in a room above the arch of the gateway. The
King&rsquo;s anger soon evaporated; after the lapse of three hours he
decided that they should be set free. The sheriff succeeded in quieting
the crowd without, and in inducing the people to return home. None of
the gentlemen, however, dared to show themselves in the neighbouring
village. They started on their retreat by different roads, and hurried
without delay to Munich. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=

<h2 class="main">A Friend in Need&mdash;Ludwig&rsquo;s
Proclamation</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was the earnest desire of all who wished the
King well that he should proceed to his capital, a course which
undoubtedly would have been the only means of saving him. He had during
the forenoon telegraphed for his aide-de-camp, Count Alfred von
D&uuml;rckheim. &ldquo;This man is attached to me,&rdquo; said he, as
he sent off the telegram. Just as the Court Commission was leaving
Neuschwanstein, after its short imprisonment, the Count arrived at
Hohenschwangau, with horses which had been driven half to death in
order to arrive in time. He hastened up to the castle. The gendarmes
and the firemen were still standing at arms outside it. D&uuml;rckheim
expressed his recognition of their conduct, but sent them home at the
King&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p class="par">The shy Ludwig, who had never been the friend of the
fair sex, had at this time a lady staying at his castle. Baroness
Truchsesz&mdash;Spanish by birth, but married into the Bavarian
aristocracy&mdash;had in the early morning hours when she heard that
his Majesty was to be incarcerated, hastened to Neuschwanstein. She had
precipitated herself into his sleeping <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>apartment, without
allowing herself to be announced, and had again and again assured him
of her devotion. He quietly permitted the stream of her eloquence to
pass over him, and gave her his hand. &ldquo;Dear Baroness,&rdquo; he
said in his most amiable tone, &ldquo;will not you allow me to send for
your husband, so that you may return to your villa under his
protection?&rdquo; The Baroness would not agree to this, but implored
Ludwig instantly to go to Munich. &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;though not at once.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will go with your
Majesty!&rdquo; she cried. He made a deprecatory gesture. &ldquo;It
would not do,&rdquo; he answered kindly. The Baroness took up her
position in the ante-room, firmly determined not to leave his
threshold. &ldquo;If matters were not so serious I should feel tempted
to laugh at the good Baroness,&rdquo; said Ludwig to Count
D&uuml;rckheim, who found her there.</p>
<p class="par">This last friend also declared his repairing to Munich
to be imperative. Had the King at this time shown himself in his
capital, it is more than probable that his people would have flocked
round him to protect him.</p>
<p class="par">He declared meanwhile that he was quite tired out;
still, he added, he would go there the following day.</p>
<p class="par">Between Bismarck and Ludwig there had always existed
very kindly relations. &ldquo;I was particularly honoured with his

"xd21e3129src" href="#xd21e3129" name="xd21e3129src">1</a> &ldquo;We
corresponded on important political questions until the last years of
his life. When he expressed his views he was as amiable towards my
person as he was intellectual in his judgment of the different
questions that were being discussed.&rdquo; At this desperate moment
both the King and Count D&uuml;rckheim bethought themselves of the
great Chancellor of the German Empire.</p>
<p class="par">The unsuccessful Court Commission, which had omitted to
give the officials of the district any intimation as to what was about
to take place, had been careful enough to inform the telegraph
officials of Hohenschwangau of the impending overthrow. Ludwig&rsquo;s
telegrams could therefore not be sent from Bavaria, but had to be
conveyed across the frontier to the neighbouring Tyrol. D&uuml;rckheim
craved Bismarck&rsquo;s help. The Chancellor answered: &ldquo;His
Majesty ought to drive at once to Munich and take care of his interests
before the assembled Parliament.&rdquo; Later, Bismarck tells us:
&ldquo;I thought thus: either the King is well, when he will follow my
advice, or he is really mad!&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;His Majesty did
not go to Munich; he took no determination; he was no longer in
possession of his mental powers, but let fate invade him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig and D&uuml;rckheim in conjunction drew up a
lengthy telegram to the Emperor of Austria, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>imploring him to intervene. &ldquo;Put
to!&rdquo; shouted the Count into the stables. &ldquo;Drive to the
Austrian frontier-town of Reutte as quickly as you can, even if you
break all your horses&rsquo; wind!&rdquo; At the same time the Empress
of Austria also exerted herself to the utmost from Possenhofen to
induce her husband to step in. Count D&uuml;rckheim, in the
King&rsquo;s name, commanded Baron Frankenstein to form a new Ministry;
and the battalion of j&aelig;gers in Kempten was ordered to come and
protect his Majesty. This last despatch went through the hands of Mayr;
the valet added to it some words which caused the commandant to ask the
Minister of War if he was to obey the order. An answer in the negative
was received.</p>
<p class="par">It cannot with certainty be shown what other precautions
Count D&uuml;rckheim took in order to save his master. He was mentioned
as the author of a proclamation which was issued the following day in
the King&rsquo;s name:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3140src" href=

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile the events in the capital went their way. On
the 10th of June the Government published the proclamation which
signified that the King&rsquo;s uncle had become Regent, and that the
Chamber was to be summoned to declare Ludwig II. insane. In the course
of the night Count D&uuml;rckheim was twice summoned by the Minister of
War to Munich. The first telegram he laid quietly aside. The second he
placed before the King, adding that unhappily he was obliged to obey
it, as in the contrary case he would be charged with insubordination.
Ludwig was in great distress at losing him. &ldquo;You know how greatly
I wish you to remain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256"

to my uncle and ask him if he will not consent to my keeping
you.&rdquo; The Count did this, but the answer to his request was short
and decided: &ldquo;The Ministry of War adheres to its orders.&rdquo;
Deeply moved, the Count took leave, never to see his King again. In the
ante-room Mayr was awaiting him. The valet, who wished the new
Government success and prosperity, was alarmed at the precautions
D&uuml;rckheim had taken. &ldquo;Do you think his Majesty will decide
to go to the capital?&rdquo; he asked. It was with a heavy heart that
the Count answered: &ldquo;No, Mayr; I do not think so.&rdquo;<a class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XL</h2>
<h2 class="main">The King&rsquo;s Last Hours at Neuschwanstein</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The gendarmes of the district were relieved during
the course of the night by others from Munich, who occupied the castle.
Ludwig, who the preceding day had overcome his enemies, thought at
first that they had arrived to protect him. It was not until he was
refused his usual midnight drive that he realised that he was a
prisoner.</p>
<p class="par">Early in the morning on the 11th of July the post
brought the proclamation from the new Regent: those who attempted to
save the King risked punishment from this time forth as traitors to
their country. Exceedingly few at Hohenschwangau seemed to think of
this; and even on the other side of the frontier there were those who
were ready to risk all for him.</p>
<p class="par">The newly-arrived gendarmes were unacquainted with the
neighbouring country, whereas the local population knew every path and
stone. By way of the Kitzberg path, in less than an hour&rsquo;s time,
the Tyrol could be reached: a carriage waiting there could have driven
Ludwig farther. In Austria it was fully expected that he would hasten
thither; even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>the Emperor himself is said to have awaited and
feared it. A number of bold and faithful dwellers in the mountain
districts were eager to hazard their lives in order to defend the
fleeing Monarch on this dangerous journey. The chief difficulty lay in
getting him unnoticed out of the castle. Those without could hardly put
themselves into communication with him, as Neuschwanstein was strictly
guarded. A lady who was passing the summer at Hohenschwangau offered to
try and penetrate in to him, to inform him of the plan. She disguised
herself as a peasant woman, and took with her the wife of a groom. All
was deadly still. The fog was so thick that it was hardly possible to
see ten steps ahead. The gendarmes had withdrawn to the interior of the
castle. An officer was standing under the arch of the gateway; he asked
the women who they were. One of them answered that she was married to
the coachman, and wished to see the wife of the valet Mayr. The officer
looked at them suspiciously. Some servants now appeared. &ldquo;Do you
know these women?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are they speaking the
truth?&rdquo; They replied in the affirmative, and the women were
allowed to pass.</p>
<p class="par">This venturesome deed led to nothing. Mayr, to whom they
addressed themselves, refused under any circumstances to support a plan
of flight. He did not even announce their arrival <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>to
the King. The latter, nevertheless, came to know of the matter. His
first question was whether his flight could be carried into effect
without the shedding of blood. When he received the answer that he must
expect a struggle to ensue, he refused to follow those who desired to
rescue him, &ldquo;I do not wish any human life to be sacrificed for my
sake,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">He was cognisant as to the means which had been used to
bring about his deposition from the throne. He was also quite aware
what information had been collected for this purpose, and likewise who
had betrayed him. &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he said to his valet Mayr,
&ldquo;that these persons, to whom I have shown so much kindness,
should have failed me so shamelessly; they have given up all my letters
and papers to my adversaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He had heard that new emissaries would come to
Neuschwanstein the next morning to take him away, with the help of
doctors and keepers; and he knew that he would be a will-less prisoner
in their hands. The excited condition in which he had passed the
previous day had been succeeded by indifference to everything, to
everyone. After Count D&uuml;rckheim&rsquo;s departure he seemed to be
completely broken. He thought no more of resistance. Another thought
ceaselessly occupied his mind. When during the course of the Friday he
showed apparent calm, it was because the idea of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>suicide was paramount. Unceasingly he walked up
and down the throne-room, and talked aloud of shortening his life.
Every now and then he addressed a few words to Weber. &ldquo;Do you
believe in the immortality of the soul?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the servant. &ldquo;I too believe in
it,&rdquo; said Ludwig. &ldquo;I believe in the immortality of the
soul, and in the justice of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;From the heights of life
to be dashed down into a nothing!&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;A spoiled
life! I <i>cannot</i> endure it. I could agree to their taking my crown
from me, but I cannot survive their declaring me to be mad. I cannot
possibly endure being treated like my brother Otto, whom every keeper
dares to order about, whom they threaten with a clenched fist when he
will not obey!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The thought of death had taken possession of his mind.
He asked his servants for cyanide of potassium; they replied that they
could not give it to him. Despite the rain which was falling that
night, he went out several times on to the balcony of the castle, which
overhangs the dizzy chasm of the P&ouml;llat. He ordered Mayr to give
him the key of the high tower of the castle, but the servant pretended
that he could not find it. A spring from the tower and the King would
be saved! &ldquo;When my barber comes to-morrow,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;he may look for my head in the P&ouml;llat.&rdquo; And he added:
&ldquo;I hope that God will vouchsafe to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>pardon me this
step!... I cannot spare my mother the pain I shall cause her,&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;They are driving me to death! But my blood will be on
all those who have betrayed me!&rdquo; He was particularly bitter
against his uncle. &ldquo;A well-beloved relation who usurps supreme
authority, and imprisons me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is no Prince
Regent; he is a Prince Rebel!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Baroness Truchsesz still continued to remain in the
ante-room; her presence began to be painful to him. He desired her
removal, but gave express orders that it should be done gently and with
consideration.</p>
<p class="par">The valet, Weber, had twice been in his service. Ludwig
gave him a diamond clasp which he was in the habit of wearing in his
hat. &ldquo;I have no money with which to reward you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Receive instead my clasp and this note of hand. If they compel
you to give up the diamonds, my document will insure you a compensation
of 25,000 marks.&rdquo; He gave him, in addition, his prayer-book,
which was much used. &ldquo;Pray for me,&rdquo; he said.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3235src" href="#xd21e3235" name="xd21e3235src">1</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It was a terrible night. The fog had turned into rain,
which was falling in torrents, and the wind was howling round
Neuschwanstein. Ludwig was almost alone in his castle, which was
completely cut off from communication with the outer world. Again he
went on to the balcony, and gazed out over the landscape, with his head
resting on his hand.</p>
<p class="par">A terrible fear came over him. He ordered Weber to
summon Osterholzer: perchance the plan of flight which had been
proposed to him before could still be put into execution. But the
coachman had been summoned to Munich; it had been intimated to him that
he would be arrested if he did not leave Hohenschwangau at once.
&ldquo;Will the people do nothing then to liberate their King?&rdquo;
His servant answered: &ldquo;Your Majesty! the people have no
weapons!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Court Commission, having suffered such ignoble
defeat the first time, had been replenished with new emissaries. But
again this time came Dr Gudden, the assistant doctor, Dr M&uuml;ller,
and eight keepers. For personal safety&rsquo;s sake these gentlemen
had, <span class="corr" id="xd21e3246" title=
"Source: moveover">moreover</span>, brought with them from Munich the
chief of the police; and they had demanded that the Regent&rsquo;s
proclamation should be published at Hohenschwangau before they
proceeded thither. The former Commission had been treated as traitors
and criminals; to the present one nobody dared show hostility.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The King had returned to the dining-room. He had never
been a drinker; but on this night he drank brandy and wine to dull his
senses.</p>
<p class="par">The envoys had meanwhile arrived at Neuschwanstein,
where they effected unhindered entrance. They were awaiting the moment
when Mayr should give them the sign that they could take his Majesty
and drive him to another castle. Ludwig had again demanded the key of
the tower. The servant, fearing that he would throw himself over, had
maintained that it was missing. For the last time he now repeated his
order. In his terror Mayr hastened to Dr Gudden and asked what he
should do. A minute afterwards he went into the presence, and announced
that the key had been found. The King rose and followed him at
once.</p>
<p class="par">Those without heard firm steps. A man of imposing height
suddenly showed himself in the doorway; he spoke in short abrupt
sentences to the servant, who stood bowing deeply.</p>
<p class="par">It had been arranged that the King should be at once
surrounded and taken away by force. But when the Monarch came out all
shrank back; nobody dared to seize him.</p>
<p class="par">Dr Gudden was the first to regain self-possession. He
stepped forward, and said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Majesty! this is the saddest task I have
ever undertaken in my life. Four alienists have given a declaration as
to the state of your Majesty&rsquo;s health. In consequence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>of this Prince Luitpold has assumed the Regency.
I have received orders to accompany your Majesty to Schloss Berg this
very night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The King hesitated a moment. &ldquo;What do you want
with me?&rdquo; he repeated several times. &ldquo;What does this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The keepers approached to seize him. He warned them off
with a proud gesture, and drew himself up.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is not necessary,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
will go of my free will.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265"

after the King&rsquo;s death, Weber proved to be in possession of his
diamond clasp, it was thought at first that he had come by it
dishonestly. The writing, however, by which he had engaged himself not
to give it up except on payment of 25,000 marks convinced the
authorities that they had been mistaken. As the diamonds constituted a
part of the Crown jewels, Weber had, nevertheless, to return them. As
far as is known he received a small sum of money in return for them, as
it was desired that the King&rsquo;s last gift should be
respected.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e3235src">&uarr;</a></p>

<h2 class="main">Schloss Berg&mdash;The King&rsquo;s Death</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At four in the morning Ludwig left
Neuschwanstein.</p>
<p class="par">In the first carriage sat Dr M&uuml;ller and two
keepers. In the second was the King, quite alone. By the side of the
coachman sat the head keeper from the madhouse at Munich, and close at
the rear of the carriage rode a man who had orders sharply to watch his
Majesty, and give a sign at the slightest suspicious movement. Dr
Gudden, a police officer, and several keepers followed afterwards. When
Ludwig had taken his seat in his equipage he said to the doctor;
&ldquo;You do not object, of course, to my taking leave of my
servant?&rdquo; Mayr stepped up to him; but the conversation seemed too
long to Dr Gudden. &ldquo;Make haste, so that we can get off,&rdquo; he
repeated several times. Mayr sobbed aloud as his master drove off.</p>
<p class="par">Some persons were standing outside to see the sorrowful
train; the King returned their greeting with amiability. At the first
turn of the road he rubbed a clear space with his hand on the damp
window, and looked back at Neuschwanstein, which he had loved so
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>dearly, and which has never since been
inhabited. He looked ill; his complexion was ashy white, his glance
irresolute. The horses were changed three times. At the last stage,
Seeshaupt, the landlady approached, and respectfully saluted his
Majesty. He asked her for a glass of water. As he handed her back the
empty glass he thanked her cordially. Weeping, she called after the
carriage: &ldquo;<i lang="de">Beh&uuml;t Gott,
Majest&auml;tt.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The new Commission had relinquished the plan of taking
him to Linderhof, as it was known that one of his j&aelig;gers was
collecting people in the Tyrol to help him over the border. While the
carriage, unhindered, was nearing Berg, one hundred and twenty peasants
were standing ready to rescue him in the vicinity of Reutte. After
waiting for two days they learned that the King had driven another
way.</p>
<p class="par">It was Dr Gudden who had decided on Schloss Berg as his
prison; this was the more wanting in consideration, since it was there
that he had spent his happy youth. Ludwig had learned to know this
physician while he was treating his brother, Prince Otto, and cherished
a peculiar antipathy to him. &ldquo;Gudden looks at me in such a
curious way,&rdquo; he said several times to his mother&rsquo;s Grand
Mistress of the Court. &ldquo;I only hope he won&rsquo;t discover
something to say about me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was the forenoon of Whitsun Eve when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>he
arrived at his destination. He spoke genially to the gendarme stationed
there. &ldquo;I am glad, Sauer, that you are on duty again,&rdquo; he
said as he went in. In one of the first apartments he entered his eyes
fell on his own portrait: a large painting which represented his first
landing at Schloss Berg after his accession. How different was that day
from this! He was given only two rooms for his use. The windows had
been hastily provided with iron bars, and holes had been bored in the
doors that he might be under continual observation. He regarded these
alterations without saying a word. The doctor ordered him to go early
to bed and he obeyed. At two in the morning he awoke, and wished to get
up. The keepers would not allow it. They had taken his clothes away
from him; despite his earnest prayers they would not give them to him.
At last one of them let himself be persuaded into letting him have his
socks. Clad only in his night-shirt and in his stockinged feet he
walked restlessly hour after hour up and down the room. At six in the
morning he asked the keeper to help him with a bath. He allowed the
former to assist him to dress, but bade him afterwards fetch his valet
and his barber. The keeper answered, what was strictly true, that they
had not come with him to his new place of residence.</p>
<p class="par">Whitsunday dawned. Ludwig wished to attend <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>divine service in the neighbouring church.
Gudden refused to allow this, fearing that the people would not believe
the King to be mad if he showed himself. In the course of the morning
he asked for an orange. It was brought to him, but without a
fruit-knife. He sent it out again without having touched it. At eleven
o&rsquo;clock Dr Gudden accompanied him on a walk. Two keepers who
followed them received a sign to increase the distance from the King.
Ludwig and the doctor seated themselves on a bench ten or fifteen paces
from the banks of the lake of Starnberg. Ludwig&rsquo;s quiet,
collected demeanour lulled the physician into a feeling of security,
which was destined to be fatal to himself.</p>
<p class="par">The King ate his dinner alone at four o&rsquo;clock.
Before seating himself at table he inquired of the keeper who waited
upon him whether Gudden had touched his food; he feared that the latter
intended to render him unconscious, and that he would show him to the
people in this condition to prove that he was mad.</p>
<p class="par">He asked to be allowed to speak with his old
acquaintance, Staff-Comptroller Zanders, who was in the castle. Gudden
at first would not hear of this; at length he gave way to the
King&rsquo;s supplication, and Zanders was allowed to be with him for
half-an-hour, but was required to promise on his word of honour not to
arouse any hope in the King&rsquo;s mind that he might <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>regain his freedom. Ludwig advanced to meet him
with the vigour and energy he displayed at his prime&mdash;quite a
different man from what he had been two days previously. He showed him
the bars before the windows, the peepholes in the door, and told him
how he had been treated. &ldquo;How many gendarmes are there in the
park to guard me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Six or eight, your
Majesty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Would they in case of emergency shoot at
me?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can your Majesty think such a thing!&rdquo; was
the answer.</p>
<p class="par">While this conversation was taking place the chief
physician was telegraphing to Munich: &ldquo;Everything is going
wonderfully well here.&rdquo; A quarter of an hour afterwards the King
started on his last walk with Gudden. The sky was overclouded, and a
drizzling rain was falling. Two keepers accompanied them. The doctor
observed that their presence was unnecessary, and soon afterwards they
returned to the castle. The King and his physician struck into the path
they had followed in the morning. Ludwig had known the banks of the
lake of Starnberg from childhood, and it is more than probable that he
had that forenoon chosen the spot where he would free himself from his
life. The physician had said he would return with the King at eight
o&rsquo;clock. Half-past eight and nine passed, but they did not
appear; and anxiety was felt at the castle in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>case
some accident might have happened to them in the darkness of the park.
The assistant doctor had the immediate vicinity carefully searched.
This led at first to no result, for no one thought of the lake of
Starnberg. Not far from the seat on which Ludwig and Gudden had rested
in the forenoon were found later the umbrellas of both men. A fisherman
was summoned; and upon rowing a short distance from the shore in his
boat the body of Dr Gudden, in a half-sitting posture, with the back
bent below the surface of the water, was discovered. A few feet farther
out was found the King&rsquo;s lifeless body, the head downwards, and
the arms bent forward. The lake was not so deep at this spot but he
could have saved himself had he been so minded.</p>
<p class="par">What had happened at this spot will for ever remain
unknown. The sorrowful incident took place without witnesses; but the
tracks along the shore, and in the bottom of the lake, which was
examined, justify the following assumption. The King was walking on the
right side, Gudden on the left, until they reached the seat they had
rested on before. The King must then have thrown down his umbrella and
run towards the lake, for his footsteps could be seen on the damp
moss-grown shore. Gudden had immediately rushed after him, and seized
him by the coat-collar. His grasp must have been very firm, for the
nail of one of his fingers was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271"
href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>splintered. Ludwig, on the
other hand, must have continued to press forward, for Gudden had
retained both the coats of the King in his hand. Above the
doctor&rsquo;s left eye there was a bruise, which undoubtedly resulted
from a blow. A terrible struggle must have taken place.</p>
<p class="par">Dr M&uuml;ller made the most strenuous efforts to call
Ludwig back to life, but all his exertions were in vain; death had
freed the mad King from the torments of his existence. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Conclusion</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the evening of Whitmonday the body of Ludwig
II. was conveyed to Munich.</p>
<p class="par">The hearse, which was drawn by four horses and was
accompanied by his servants and by priests, arrived at the capital at
half-past three in the morning. Great numbers of country people
followed his coffin weeping. Nobody believed he had been mad, but that
an innocent man had been persecuted. In the hearts of all there lived
the memory of the beloved King, who had promised so much, whose
peculiarities they had condoned, and who, despite all, had continued to
be the pride of the Bavarians.</p>
<p class="par">The news of his tragic end shocked the whole of Germany.
His capital, where he had so seldom resided, mourned him deeply and
sincerely; and in the country districts there was hardly a hut where
his picture was not wreathed with crape. The dead King lay in state on
a high catafalque, dressed in the knightly robes of the order of St
Hubert, with its golden band round his neck, and the sword of iron
resting on his left arm. On his breast lay flowers, brought by the
Empress Elizabeth. Thousands <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href=
"#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>of all grades of society pressed
into the little chapel to bid him a last farewell. Sorrow was written
on all faces; sympathy found expression on all lips. The lonely
eccentric had found peace at last.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Queen Marie&rsquo;s strength had been broken by sorrow;
she outlived her eldest son by only two years. &ldquo;Bavaria&rsquo;s
unhappiest mother&rdquo; expired on the 17th of May, 1889, at
Hohenschwangau, where she had lived the full and happy years of her
youth. With the words: &ldquo;God save Bavaria, God save
Prussia!&rdquo; she drew her last sigh.</p>
<p class="par">The Duchesse d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on was visiting her
parents at Possenhofen, when her former betrothed found his death in
the neighbouring lake of Starnberg. The news of it so greatly shocked
her that she temporarily lost her reason.</p>
<p class="par">Ludwig&rsquo;s deposition and violent death called forth
stormy debates in the Bavarian Chamber. In order to convince the world
that his treatment had been justified, the Ministry revealed without
mercy the development of his disease; and eminent alienists were
unanimous in their declaration that for several years his mind had been
clouded.</p>
<p class="par">But to this day there are many among his people who do
not believe it.</p>
<p class="par">Bavaria has not forgotten King Ludwig, and the traits of
geniality and kindness, by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>which he won all, are still spoken
of with love. In those parts where he mostly resided the remembrance of
the &ldquo;romanticist on the throne&rdquo; dwells fresh and warm in
the hearts of the people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
